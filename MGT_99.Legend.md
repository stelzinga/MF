# INTRODUCTION
This note acts as the legend, or explanation, of the *Management Framework* a.k.a. *MF*, an intertwined set of concepts and conventions for the purpose of Managing a *Venture*, see section PROFILE below.
  
The MF is composed of two notes: this note, MGT: 99.Legend, which explains overall concepts, whereas the second note, MGT: 80.Tools, focuses on the application of those concepts through so called Tools, discussed in more detail below.
  
This note has the following sections:
- Introduction 
- License
- Disclaimer
- Profile
- Bibliography
- Versions
  
Conventions used in this note like [# NOTES] and [MGT: 01.Planning] as well as so called Markdown formatting like *italic* and **bold** are explained in the note MGT: 80.Tools in the section on Notes. 
  
A *section* is the same as a chapter in text books. A section is visualised either by starting with '#' , '##', '###', etc. reflecting an increasing granular level like 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. or a special format e.g., larger and bolder letters if the same content is displayed in a tool supporting Markdown.

# DISCLAIMER
________________________________________
## Gender
This note assumes a Manager is male. Not so much because Managers are, or should be, male. It is more to keep language concise. Instead of constantly writing his/her, him/her, he/she, only the former version is used: his/him/he. 
________________________________________
## Non-Managers
This note assumes that the the principles applicable to a Manager, are effectively applicable to any Staff in a Venture, although Manager level employees, may have more often an opportunity to apply the Tools mentioned in this note. 
________________________________________
## Reliability of Content
The content of the Framework (both this note, as well as the note MGT: 80.Tools)  is borne from two aspects: experience and research. Not all aspects discussed have had the merit of a well rounded experience or application of the theory. Which aspect of the Management Framework has or has not had that exposure is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, given that Management is both a topic of academic research, but also, if not more, an experience based topic, it is quite possible certain concepts written in these notes, are also part of academic research, without that academic research having been cited, simply because it was not read by the author. If such research is available, the reader is asked to notify the author, such that the latter can review the research and integrate it in the framework if that were to be deemed relevant.
  
  
*********************************************
# PROFILE
This section explains the concept of a *Profile* including how it is used in Management. The first section gives an overview of what a Profile is. The sections thereafter provide further details for each of the aspects of the Profile. Words with capitalised first letters are deemed *core* to the Profile. 

The Profile is a foundational *conceptual* structure that can be used by Managers at all levels. The Profile is based on academic resources, industry specialist, as well as own experience. Resources are cited where possible.  
________________________________________
## Profile Overview
The *Management Tree*, *Management Profile* or *Profile*, is the building block of the Management Framework. It incorporates fundamental concepts of management theory as well as experience. The Profile explains the structure a Manager is accountable for in a holistic manner, whilst leaving room to adapt to specific circumstances e.g., different business structures and different sectors.

The Profile is designed around the concept of a *Venture*. A Venture is a Company, Organisation, Corporation or Enterprise. The Management Framework uses the term Venture to avoid differences, subtle or not, on structures that are not relevant to the concepts themselves.
________________________________________
## Profile Tree
The Profile expresses a Venture through a *Profile Tree*, composed of interrelated *Profile Tree Items* as follows:

- Venture

This visual representation is expanded upon in below "Profile Tree Executive Summary", which is short enough to be integrated in documents that only need an overview of the basic concepts of the Profile. The rest of the sections detail each Profile Tree Item.
________________________________________
## Profile Tree Executive Summary
The main objective of a *Venture* (a Company, Organisation, Corporation or Enterprise) is to generate more *Revenue*, or *Income* from the sales of *Services* (and/or *Goods*) to *Clients* than the *Cost* to yield those Services through *Operations*. Operations consists of all *Processes*¹⁾ contributing directly or indirectly to the continuous delivery and subsequent sales of Services in a *sustainable* manner a.k.a. *Run*, as well as continuous improvement of that Run a.k.a. *Change*. A Process consists of *Steps* applied to *Input* to achieve a *Result*. The Processes in Operations are performed and/or overseen by *Staff* (employees) using *Assets* and *Suppliers* (which can be internal or external). Combined, Staff, Assets, Suppliers are called *Resources*. Resources generate Costs (salaries, rent, depreciation, electricity, costs of goods sold, fees, etc.) as do the results of Operations e.g., Income tax. These Costs are covered by *Financing* or *Funding* through Cash (fundamental Asset) made available through Revenue, *Liabilities* and *Equity*. Operations also generate *Risk*, defined as the probability of unplanned events with adverse outcomes. The latter are either directly (loss of Revenue, fines, recall of Services, legal costs) or indirectly (loss or damage of Resources). Unplanned events occur as result of i) failures in Processes and/or Staff, Suppliers or Assets and/or ii) as a result of unforeseen conditions created internally (Management, Staff, Suppliers, Assets) or externally (Suppliers, Clients, and *Environment*), where Environment²⁾ consists of external forces that influence Clients, Services, Operations and Management either directly or indirectly without any of them having direct control over that influence, and which includes forces like law, weather, availability of raw materials, investors, creditors, competitors, regulators, labour unions, etc., and it also includes changes in these forces through politics, public opinion, inventions and observations through scientific and human research, investigative news, etc. In short, Risk³⁾ is a form of *probabilistic* Cost, and the management of Risk incurs an *actual* Cost e.g., extra Staff, insurance, backup Assets etc.. Revenue minus Cost is called *Earnings* or *Profit*. Revenue, Cost and Profit are expressed in monetary values, as is Risk whenever possible. Revenue and Cost make up one of the key *Financial Statements* called *Income Statement* whereas Assets⁴⁾, Liabilities and Equity make up the *Balance Sheet*. 
Operations are conceptually simple with five inputs (Staff, Assets, Suppliers, Liabilities, Equity) and five outputs (Run, Change, Revenue, Cost, Risk). Operations are initiated, maintained and subsequently improved through *Management* which *refines* Operations through four *Management Functions*: *Planning*, *Organising*, *Leading* and *Controlling* a.k.a. *POLC*, such that Profit is maximised and Risk minimised⁵⁾ within the constraints of Funding. Planning consists of strategy *formulation* for short to long-term *periods*, whereas Organising and Leading constitute strategy *implementation* over those periods and Controlling consists of *verifying* the results of the implementation. 
  
Planning establishes *what is to be done where, when, why and how* by defining why the Venture exists (*Context*, *Purpose*, *Vision* and *Mission*), within which boundaries it expects to operate (*Values* and *Bylaws*), and how it assesses the Environment versus its own performance (*SWOT* and *Intel*). Planning defines *Goals* and *Objectives*. Run Goals focus on continuously delivering Services to Clients whilst assuring the Result is as expected. There are four essential Run Goals: a) Manage Venture, b) Perform production (Value Chain), c) Perform oversight (Control Chain) and d) Perform overhead (anything not contributing to a-c but required nevertheless). Change Goals *improve* Run Goals to a) Grow Revenue, b) Protect existing Revenue at risk of being lost, c) Secure Run to reduce Risk, and d) Optimise Run to reduce Cost and/or increase Revenue. Goals have *Sub-Goals* focused on specific Services or Clients. An Objective is a *precise*, *time-based* Process or series of Processes, the output of which supports the completion of a (Sub-)Goal and thus the delivery of a Service or improvement thereof. Objectives consume Assets and Suppliers and are performed or overseen by Staff. Objectives are either *Routines* (tie into Run Goals) or *Projects* (tie into Change Goals). Planning establishes performance metrics or *Benchmarks* used in Controlling. Planning yields a *Strategic Plan*, *Tactical Plan* and/or *Operational Plan* a.k.a. *Operating Model* (a blueprint of the entire Profile Tree).  
  
Organising establishes *how to do it* and *who does it* by defining the *Activities* which regroup related Sub-Goals or Objectives and defines how Staff are organised in *Groups* or *Teams* linked to those Activities. Groups thus reflect Activities. The sum of Groups (and thus Activities) is the Venture's Organisation reflected in an *Organisational Chart*. Organising establishes *Roles & Responsibilities* which includes the concept of *Delegation* of *Responsibility* and *Authority* across Objectives thus creating *Accountability* within the Venture. 
  
Leading involves Processes to *drive* those *who do it* by directing, influencing, inspiring, and motivating individual Staff and Groups to achieve the Objectives. A key aspect is a *Safe Space* such that *collaboration*, *motivation*, *inspiration*, and *learning* are maximised. Leading, also grooms future *Managers*. 
   
Controlling involves Processes to establish *how well it was done* by measuring the Result of Operations and Management versus the benchmarks from Planning, and adjusting through Planning, Organising and Leading. Controlling is done through *Supervision* via a *Supervision Framework* composed of *Supervision Processes* or *Controls* of four types: a) *Check* (verify a Result vs benchmark), b) *Review*: (verify a Result vs an opinion), c) *Attend* a *Committee* (verify Result vs a broader range of opinions) or d) *Audit* (verify Results or Objectives vs an *independent* opinion). Controls result in *Reports* with suggestions for improvements. *Monitoring* assures tracking, and implementation of those improvements. Lastly, *Journaling* is used to keep track of work done across all four Management Functions. 
  
In theory POLC are performed sequentially, but in reality, Managers iteratively perform them through a continuous *Management Cycle*. Management also assesses the efficiency of itself though *Management Improvement*. 
  
Management is aided in its objectives by *Business Functions*⁶⁾ that specialise in specific, more transversal, aspects of the Venture e.g., Finance, HR, IT, Risk, Compliance, Corporate Secretary, Procurement, etc. Management also uses *Management Tools* or *Tools* in the form of *Research*, *Definitions*, *Frameworks*, *Procedures* and *Software*. These Tools aid in the performance of the Management Functions. Finally, the Management Framework permeates the entire Venture and can be applied to varying extent at any *Management Level* in the Venture (Director of the Board, CEO, department head, team leader, etc).   
  
It is worth noting that the Profile is a simplification of complex concepts that have many properties and these concepts are often implemented in complex company structures. Additionally, the proposed structure in the Profile is a *possible* way of looking at a Corporation, it is certainly not the only way. Nevertheless, the simplification helps see the trees in the forest, and revert to the fundamentals of what a Venture is ultimately about.  
  
Notes:  
¹⁾ Processes are *embedded* in most aspects of the Profile Tree, and are thus not a separate Profile Tree Item.  
²⁾ Although at the top of the Profile Tree, Environment impacts *the entire Venture*.  
³⁾ Services and Products often embed Risk e.g., financial products, machinery, drugs, etc. The pro-active management of this Risk is part of Operations.  
⁴⁾ Assets on the Balance Sheet are a sub-set of Assets in Operations, e.g., a *procedure* is an Asset in Operations but not in the Balance Sheet.  
⁵⁾ Asssuming Risk is just a (probabilistic) Cost, the objective of the Management Functions is thus Profit maximisation. 
⁶⁾ Business Functions can be construed as being Activities. However, in the corporate world they are often defined separately and for the sake of clarity it is done here too. Additionally, Operations are sometimes considered a Business Function.
  
Although the Profile Tree is focused on Profit making Ventures, the concepts apply equally to non-profit organisations like charities, religious institutions etc., the main differences are 1) the manner in which Operations are funded (membership fees, donations, government subsidies) and 2) the main target is not to achieve Profit maximisation but rather the continuation of Operations i.e., to have enough funding to cover the Cost.
________________________________________
## Alternative Views of the Profile Tree
The Profile Tree can be assessed in different manners each enforcing a better understanding of a Venture. These alternative ways  are discussed below. 
  
### Profile Tree Top and Bottom
Another way to understand the Profile Tree is to break it down into two parts: *Top Profile Tree* and *Bottom Profile Tree*, indicated by the two blocks between the dotted lines in above diagram. The Top Profile Tree says: 
- What is created (Services)
- Whom receives those Services (Clients)
- Which constraints and dependencies affect the manner in which the Services are created and maintained (Environment)
  
The Bottom Profile Tree focuses on:
- How is the Top Profile Tree achieved (Operations)
- How are Operations improved (Management)
- How is Management aided (Business Functions & Tools) 

The Bottom Profile Tree emphasises the fact that Management creates and maintains Operations which ultimately yield Revenue, Cost and Risk, and that those Operations are performed by Staff using Assets and Suppliers which are funded by Cash from Revenue, Liabilities and Equity.

### Reduced Profile Tree
The Reduced Profile Tree or *RPT* expands, on part of the Bottom Profile Tree. It contains 16 *RPT Items*:
- 3 Resources: Assets, Staff and Suppliers
- 2 Funding items: Liabilities, Equity with Cash deemed part of Assets. 
- 4 Management Functions: Planning, Organising, Leading and Controlling
- 4 deliverables from Planning and Organising namely *Goals* & *Objectives* and *Activities* & *Groups*.
- 3 deliverables from Operations: Revenue, Cost, Risk

The RPT looks like this:
  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
           Revenue, Cost, Risk

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    
[Fig 2: the Reduced Profile Tree]
  
This view enables Staff and Managers alike to see the relation between Operations and Management with regards to aspects that are recognisable within a Venture.  
  
### Expanded Profile Tree
By combining the Profile Tree and the Reduced Profile Tree we obtain a more comprehensive view called the *Expanded Profile Tree* with 28 Expanded Profile Tree Items:

[Fig 3: Expanded Profile Tree]
  
The Profile Tree, Reduced Profile Tree and Expanded Profile Tree provide *structure* and *insight* as to how each item plays a part in a Venture and how items are interrelated. The relative importance of each depends on the Venture. 

### Wrapping it up
Operations as mentioned is the central part of the Profile Tree and is represented by the combination of Activities & Groups + Goals & Objectives + Resources + the funding of those Resources via Liabilities and Equity. Operations are often divided into different functional units like Sales, Marketing, Research & Development, etc. However, from a Profile perspective these functional units are just different names for Activities.  
Management initiates, maintains and continuously improves Operations.  
Operations and Management both have the notion of Process embedded and as such, Processes are not reflected as a Profile Tree Item. Finally, the Profile is a framework. As such there are many ways to use it and it is up to the Manager to use it such that it adds the most value to the Venture.

### Going Further
Words with capitalised first letters are core to the Profile. They are either a Profile Tree Item or a deliverable related to it. The [## Profile Tree Executive Summary] reflects the majority of these capitalised words which are detailed in the rest of this note starting with Tools to introduce several concepts deemed key for the understanding of the rest of the document. Each Profile Tree Item has a dedicated level 2 section within section. Each deliverable has a level 3 section within those level 2 sections. More details on section levels can be found in the note MGT: 80.Tools in section NOTES. 
________________________________________
## Tools
Management Tools or short Tools aid Managers in the performance of Management. It is worth noting that "tools" are of course used everywhere including in Operations, to aid in the performance of Run and Change e.g., a wrench, software, printer, etc.  However, those tools are deemed Assets. In other words in the Management Framework, Tools means Management Tools and it refers to any Tool used as part of Management. If such tools can also aid elsewhere in the Profile Tree, even better. Tools have the following deliverables: 
 
### Research
Research is the result of reading, watching, or listening to various sources of data to enhance the manner in which a Manager performs his role. Sources include academic literature, books, newspapers, articles, documentaries, blogs, podcasts etc. The vast majority of which is nowadays available online. It also includes interactions with other Managers, alumni and other individuals or groups that have exposure to Management.

### Definition
A Definition helps shaping and scoping specific topics such that they are understood in the same way across Management or the entire Venture. Definitions also include conventions used. For example, Bylaws (within  Planning) often consists of many definitions.
  
### Framework
A Framework is a conceptual structure intended to support a specific aspect of a Management Function's Processes. It acts as a guideline that helps Managing a topic without being specific about Processes involved in it. Being guidelines Frameworks are not absolute truths nor do they guarantee perfect outcomes. 
  
### Procedure
A Procedure is an established or formalised manner of performing a Process. It is a well documented explanation of what to do, how, where, when, and by whom. Procedures are used to define, configure and perform Processes in an optimal manner. Unlike Frameworks, a Procedure yield precise Results, and it involves manual work. Example: managing email. Like Frameworks, the concept of Procedure is relevant to Operations.
  
### Software
A Software is downloaded for free, purchased or built. It achieves a specific outcome either by configuration, automating a manual Process, and/or by simplifying a Process even if it remains partially manual. Example: a Note Taking application. 

The Profile is itself a Framework whereas the Profile Tree Items are forms of Definition. Some key Tools used in the rest of this Note are discussed below:
  
### 6W Framework
The 6W Framework aids in framing *any* topic by enforcing answers to 6 fundamental questions: *What*, *Where*, *When*, *Who*, *Why* and *How* a.k.a. *Which* (hence 6W). The following are examples for each:
- What: short name, description, overview, ...
- Where: geographical location in building, asset, ...
- When: history of topic, future deliveries, recurrence, ...
- Who: person/people doing or receiving something, skills, ...
- Why: purpose of topic, relevance to other topics, ...
- Which: a.k.a. How, manner in which topic is achieved, ...
  
The 6W Framework is used throughout the Management Framework.
  
### Process Definition
It can be argued that a Process does not really require a definition, given its commonness. However, it is preferable to have a formal definition that can be used systematically across the Profile. The reason for this is that a Process is so fundamental to what happens within a Venture that assuming everybody interprets it the same way, may be wrong and thus yield sub-par results when using the Management Framework.   
  
A Process is one or more *triggered* or *continuous* *Steps* applied to one, or more forms of *Input* to achieve one, or more forms of desired *Output* or *Result*:
  
    Input(s)  ⇒  Step(s)  ⇒  Result(s)
  
A well designed Process is completely defined by the 6W Framework: Where, What, When, Who, Why and How or Which. In other words What Result is to be delivered, Where and When, *by* Whom and *for* Whom, Why is the Result relevant, and How is the Result achieved i.e., which Inputs are used and what does each Step do with the Input. Note that Where can be a geographic location, but can also refer to an Asset in which a Process is embedded.
  
Output is determined by what is the *desired* Result. This thus drives the design of the Steps and the Input. The actual output may differ of course from what was intended i.e., a faulty, or weak Process.  
  
Input can be any of the following: Assets, Services from Suppliers and Results from other Processes or from the Process itself (internal loop back). Therefore, they have constraints: time, energy, manpower, cost, etc. 
  
Steps represent the *logic* of the Process: they determine how Input is transformed into a specific Result. They may be manual or automatic (the latter case is triggered manually or by another Process).  
  
It is possible, and even likely, that several Processes, and thus Results, need to be combined to obtain a final Result. Such combined Processes have different names e.g., Activities, Macro-Processes, Process Group, etc.
  
Processes can have several properties or attributes.
  
*Process Status* is an indication of whether a Process is active, suspended, failing , etc. Assigning a status helps in dealing with Processes in a structured manner. Depending on the type of Process or the purpose of the Process, different statuses can exist. 
  
*Process Maintenance* is the notion of manually or automatically applying specific Processes to other (target) Processes to assure such target Process keeps yielding the expected Result over time. As these are extra Processes purely built to keep the target Process operational it adds to the overall Cost of the target Process.
   
*Process Complexity* is determined by the multitude and complexity of the Steps and/or Input. Process Complexity has an impact on Process Maintenance. There is no generally accepted standard in terms of how to rate Process complexity. 
  
A *Process Owner* is the Group or Staff expected to yield a Result, making a Process Owner the Result Owner. However, they may not own the Input which may be produced by Processes outside of Process Owner remit, i.e., the owner faces a *dependency* on other Process and thus Process Owners. 
  
*Process Cost* is the cost of a Process. Often this Cost is hard to price, and may not be relevant on a per Process basis. Nevertheless, each Process incurs cost. Process Cost can be related to time spent by Staff on a Process.
  
A Process has Risk associated to it, by definition, see above. The assessment of that Risk for a given Process is key in Risk Management. Sometimes specific Processes are designed to verify another Process has yielded a specific Result as per expectations. Such a Process is referred to as a Control or a Check. By definition, even Controls have Risk embedded in them.
    
Optimising Processes such that they are at lowest Cost and generate the least Risk possible, is key in Management.
    
Any Process should directly or indirectly:
- Maintain or Increase Revenue and/or  
- Maintain or Reduce Risk and/or  
- Maintain or Reduce Cost and/or  
- Report to Stakeholders or improve an aspect to one or more Stakeholders not part of the above 
    
If a Process does not do the above directly or indirectly then it  likely should not be performed at all. The assessment is easy for Processes that directly have an influence as per above. It is more difficult to establish for Processes that contribute indirectly i.e., the path from the Process to the final desired result is long or very involved. For example, more motivated Staff could lead to increased Revenue, but that link is difficult to establish. The truth is that, particularly in large organisations, the majority of Processes are indirect. This is typically reviewed by Managers either directly or through audits, or through a specific Framework called Business Process Analysis or Business Process Engineering.
  
### Stakeholder Definition
Stakeholders are people affected by the Venture. They are either internal (Staff, Manager) or external (Environment, Clients, Suppliers, and including people impacted without being any of the previous for example citizens living in a zone of Operations of a Venture). The consideration of their interests falls within a Manager's remit.
  
### Profile Tree Item Numbering Framework
From a managerial perspective the order of the items in the Profile Tree is mostly followed in reverse order i.e. first Management, then Operations, Services, Clients and last but not least Environment. In other words, and using numbers to enforce the order in which they are used: 
  
00.Management
    01.Planning
    02.Organising
    03 Leading
    04.Controlling
10.Operations
    11.Staff
    12.Assets
    13.Suppliers
    14.Liabilities 
    15.Equity
20.Services
30.Clients 
40.Environment
  
and the Business Functions in the 50 range: 
  
50.Business Functions
    51.Finance
    52.HR

The Legend, which contains the Profile as overarching Framework, has the highest number in the naming convention: 99.Legend. 
    
All Profile Tree Items other than Tools are explained in below sections in the order they appear in the Profile Tree, including the above mentioned Business Functions.
  
Using numbers allows having a numbering with sub-numbers e.g., "02.01.Activities" as first deliverable within 02.Organising which yields 02.01.Activities. This allows effectively building a hierarchy of notes that follow something akin to the "Dewey Decimal Classification" (refer to Wikipedia.for more details).

## Venture 
Strictly speaking, a Company, Enterprise or Corporation is what is happening within the two blocks between the dotted lines in fig 1. The Services produced within dotted lines i.e., within the Company, but then sold to the Clients, which sit outside of the Company. The Services are effectively what links the Company to the Clients. However, in the Management Framework, the Venture is larger than the Company, Enterprise or Corporation. It is the total of aspects of the Profile Tree to emphasise how all aspects of the Profile Tree are of constant importance to Management.
  
The key aspects of the Venture are the type of Venture it is, which turn drives several aspects of Operations and Management of it. 
    
### Ownership
A Venture is an entity that ultimately generate Revenue, generate Cost and Risk and engage in various forms of Liabilities. Someone is to receive the benefit of those Revenues, has to pay for the Cost, and be answerable to repay any debt that was taken on. This person (or people) is the Owner of the Venture. The Ownership concept is key in the Company Structure. 
  
### Company Structure
The Company Structure or Business Structure refers to the legal implementation of a Company. Such implementation is partially driven by the type and size of the Venture, but also the country in which the Company operates. Note that the size of a company can change over time, and a result the Company Structure can change accordingly. The constitution of a company under a country's specific set of laws is called *business formation*. As business formation is country specific it is not possible to give all possible exact definitions of legal forms of a business. However, there are general Company Structure types that are recognised in some form, in most countries. Note that there is a difference between a company and a corporation which will become clear when reviewing the different types of companies below. 
  
- Sole proprietorship: one individual handles all Operations as well as Management of the company. The Sole Proprietor is also the Owner of the company and assumes liability of the debt of the company.
- General Partnership: this follows similar form and structure as the Sole Proprietorship, but has two or more individuals called *Partners* who are the Owners and who run Operations and Management. They thus assume liability for losses and debt and any misconduct that occurs from *either* Partner.
- Limited Liability Partnership: an LLP refers to a Company where each Partner has a predetermined threshold of liability for the losses or debts of the Company. The Partners generally assume responsibility for their own actions but not the misconduct or faults of the *other* Partners.
- Limited Liability Company: an LLC refers to a Company that combines aspects of a Partnership and a Corporation (see below). It has the legal status of a Corporation but follows tax regulations of a Partnership or Sole Proprietorship.
- Corporation: a Corporation is a specific form of Company which has  to a Company as a legal entity separate from its Owners. Corporations perform the basic functions of a company (Operations) and often operate on a larger scale. Unlike all above forms, Corporations sell shares to the public which can include private entities like asset managers, pension funds, etc. By selling shares to public they relinquish ownership to *Shareholders*.  The Shareholders are not personally liable for debt or actions taken by the Corporation. However, any losses will be reflected in the shares held. Shareholders are only the Owner. The people making decision for and within the company are its Management, specifically the Executives i.e., the senior management of C-suite Management Level (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc) all the way down to line Management who lead Staff.
  
Above forms all assume Ventures whose main purpose is to increase profitability. There are of course other forms of Ventures that have different objectives. For example religious institutions, governmental or state owned institutions and charities. Such Ventures mostly follow the concepts of the Profile Tree: they provide some form of -potentially free- Service through Operations which can be continuously improved through Management. 
  
The Management Framework covers all above forms of company, but will, as often as possible assume the scope at the level of a Corporation as form of Venture. 
      
### Agency Problem
The Agency problem occurs when people making decisions (agent) on behalf of owners (principal) have a conflict of interest. For example, a Manager (agent) may have an interest to not merge with another company as it would reduce its sphere of influence, whereas from a profit maxmimisation perspective it would be in the interest of the Shareholder (principal) to merge. The Agency problem is inherent to a structure where ownership and decision making is decoupled i.e., in Corporations. In Corporations Executives make decisions in relation to investments, financing including taking on liabilities in the form of debt, and the decisions can be to the betterment of themselves and at the expense of shareholders, at a cost which is referred to at the Agency Cost (Larcker, 2021). The Agency cost can be substantial to investors. 
  
To decrease the Agency Cost a system of checks and balances is put in place across the Venture and this is called Corporate Governance (Larcker, 2021).
  
### Corporate Governance 
Larcker (2021) defines Corporate Governance as the collection of control mechanisms an organisation adopts to prevent or dissuade potentially self-interested Managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders and stakeholders. Said differently, and expressing it with regards to the Profile, Corporate Governance refers to the manner in which Roles & Responsibilities are distributed from Owners of the Corporation through Management all the way to the Staff performing Operations such as to avoid or minimise Agency Cost. 
    
The classic approach of Corporate Governance is as follows (Monks, 2011):
- Shareholders are the Owners of the Venture and expect sustainable growth. They elect or *vote* for a small group of people called the *Board of Directors* to represent their interests. The more shares someone holds, the more it can direct the constitution of the Board of Directors.    
- Board of Directors: a.k.a. *BOD* are people elected by Shareholders to represent shareholder interests by setting the strategic direction of the Venture and by monitoring Management's performance in achieving it. The BOD focuses mostly on the Executive level output.  
- Management: people assigned with the improvement of Operations such that they yield the strategy within applicable constraints of incorporation. As mentioned before this goes from Executives or C-suite level all the way down to line Management who ultimately lead Staff. 
- Staff: people who perform Operations which, if done as planned, yields the strategy set out by the BOD.

However, modern Corporate Governance covers a wider scope and includes the Managers, Board of Directors, Investors, Auditors, Customers, Suppliers, Unions, Media, Regulators, Analysts and Creditors (Larcker, 2021). 
  
Ultimately, good Corporate Governance decreases the Agency Cost whilst the implementation cost is less than said Agency Cost. 
  
### Link to Profile
How do the above concepts of Corporate Governance and Agency Problem link to the Management Framework? More specifically, is there a different type of Management involved if one is Shareholder vs a Director vs a Manager vs Staff?

Corporate Governance is a vast domain, and although it is important for Managers to be well aware of the importance of it, it is not the focus of the Framework. 
________________________________________
## Environment
The Environment of a Venture consists of *external forces* that can, and often will, influence Clients, Services, Operations or Management, either directly or indirectly and without the Venture having any form of control over that influence. Even if the Profile Tree shows it at the top, it is applicable *throughout* the entire Venture. Environment is important in SWOT analysis (see below) and general Risk Management. 

The Environment has two dimensions: 
1. The Country/countries out of which the Venture operates and/or where the Clients and/or Competitors are located, and 
2. The Sector(s) the Venture operates in. 
  
These aspects drive forces like business law, tax law, natural factors like weather, availability of raw materials, infrastructure, investors a.k.a. shareholders, creditors, competitors, regulators, labour unions, markets, etc. It also includes changes in these forces through politics, public opinion, inventions and observations through research, investigative news, etc. 
  
These dimensions of a Venture are considered the deliverables of Environment:
- Country 
- Sector 
  
### Country
The following are relevant properties for Country:
-  Geography: includes consequences of the location the Venture operates in and which are not Climate related e.g. soil, volcanoes, risk of earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.
- Climate: a catch-all term for weather and climate including tornadoes, monsoon, drought, etc.
- Nature: natural plant and wildlife as a result of Climate, Geography as well as Society. 
- Infrastructure: represents facilities available in a Country that support the Venture including access to real estate, energy, telecommunication and transportation.
- Society: total of social forces excluding Politics and Economics. It includes aspects like art, cuisine, music, movies, sports, religion, healthcare and demographics.
- Politics: represents the governmental and judicial structure, and also includes military as extension of politics, data privacy laws.
- Economy: supply/demand of goods and services within a country, as well as the dependency on other countries for such supply/demand. 
- Tax: determines profit tax, but also income tax of Staff salaries, and often also accounting standards to be used by the Venture.
- Regulators: regulations have a direct impact on Services and/or Operations and/or an indirect impact through Clients, Suppliers. 
    
### Sector Definition
Market Sector, Economic Sector or Sector in short, defines a regrouping of similar types of Services. There are different types and different qualifications of Sectors. The one used in the Management Framework is the official Global Industry Classification Standard or GICS® (MSCI et al, 2023). The GICS uses 11 Sectors, which each contain 2 or more Industry Groups, which each contain 1 or more Industries, which each contain 1 or more Sub-industries. For this note the Sector-level is sufficient in general:
- Energy (oil, natural gas, but not renewables which are under Utilities)
- Materials (provide services to other manufacturers)
- Industrials (heavy equipment companies, including airline, railroad, logistics companies)
- Utilities (renewables, electricity delivery, natural gas transmission, water delivery)
- Healthcare (development of pharmaceuticals, healthcare equipment)
- Financials (anything handling money, including insurance)
- Consumer Discretionary (companies producing Services depending on financial status of Clients)
- Consumer Staples (anything Clients need regardless of financial status e.g., food, beverage tobacco, personal care)
- Information Technology (anything related to digital not part of communication Services)
- Communication Services (telecommunications like telephony, but also media and entertainment companies like TV and interactive entertainment via internet)
- Real Estate (development of, and maintenance of real estate)
  
Ventures can operate in one or more Sectors. For example the Indian Company "Reliance Industries" offers services across many of above Sectors.
  
The following are properties related to Sectors:
-Competitors: offer similar/same Services to similar/same Clients. They are an integral part of Economics in terms of supply and demand. Competitors offering services closest to the Venture's Services are called *Peers*. 
- Investors: represent people financing the Venture. The Business Function Finance, see below, is directly related for this aspect. 
- Regulators: a body defining rules, guidances, regulations that need to be, or are strongly recommended to be, adhered to. Most sectors have some form of Regulator or at least a set of laws. However, most regulators are Sector *and* Country specific.
- Technology: a main driver of innovation and thus is key to the Venture.

It is worthwhile mentioning that some of these forces may not directly impact the Venture, but rather the Clients, Suppliers or Staff related to the Venture. For example income tax is not directly applicable to the Venture (profit or corporate tax is), but high income tax regimes means the cost of living is higher which may make it more difficult to attract skilled Staff from lower income tax countries.  
________________________________________
## Clients
Customers or Clients consist of *external* or *internal* individuals, groups, or corporations receiving the benefit of Services. Without Clients, there is no purpose for Services to be delivered. Understanding Clients's needs and constraints is thus critical to assuring Services are optimal. Obtaining this insight is often part of an Activity called Marketing or Sales.

Obviously the range of Clients is vast, from individuals to entire Companies and anything in between like Small and Medium Enterprises. How a Venture manages its Clients depends among others on where a Client is located within this range, but also the sector in which the Venture offers its Services to those Clients. 

The following are key aspects of each Client:
- Type: is the Client an individual or a corporate i.e., is the Client itself a Venture. Depending on this typology below questions may or may not have an answer.
- Client Category: depending on the Client type this includes demographic aspects (individuals) and Sector(s) for corporates and can include tiering based on relative size within those corporates e.g., a tier one bank.
- Overview: Description, can include, history of the client itself, as well as the history of the relationship with the Client
- Environment: the Environment the Client operates in, which can partially, or fully overlap with the Venture
- Competitors: the Competitors of the Client, which can all or partially be Client of the Venture as well.
- Suppliers: the providers of Services to the Client. These Suppliers can be competitors to the Venture, or not if they do not operate in the same Sector or Country. 
- Service: Services offered by the Venture and used by the Client as well as Services the Client uses, but which are not offered to the Client, or which are not part of the Service offering by the Venture .
- Revenue: the Revenue of the Venture associated to the Client, but also the total Revenue of the Client,
- Cost: Cost associated to maintaining the relationship with the Client, as well as the Cost structure and actual Cost of offering the Services the Client offers. 
- Risk: Risk associated to maintaining the relationship with the Client
- Contact: Group/Groups owning or having a relationship with the Client.
________________________________________
## Services
Services is a single term used to describe Goods and Services. Goods can be raw materials , finished Products or anything in between. Services are items of value to Clients and for which they are willing to do an effort to obtain them, or for which they will be appreciative in some manner, most often monetary. In certain cases Services can be composed of Services *and* Products. For example stock exchanges deliver various Products (Stock, ETF, Warrants, Options, ...) through various Services (Trading, Clearing, Settlement, Market Data, ...) or Computer Hardware companies sell Products (computers) but also offers Services (repair, advice) to service those Products.
Some Services are for the benefit of the Venture itself i.e., internal Services e.g., Risk Management, Help-desk, IT Support, etc. 
Services are expected to be of good *quality* which stipulates a Service should respond *simultaneously* to:
- Client expectations and
- Lawful or regulatory requirements

Key deliverables for Services are:
- Run
- Change

### Run
These are the Services Clients tend to expect either because they already receive it, or because they are an accepted norm of level of Service, or because it is a mandated Service e.g., regulatory requirement.

### Change
Change Services consists of Services applied to Run Services such that the Run Services generate more Revenue, and/or protects existing Revenue and/or at lower Cost and/or at lower Risk. 

For each Service, there are various aspects:
- Overview: description which can include aspects like history, Environment, and including details of what the Service consists of and what the benefit is for the Client / Venture.
- Internal/External: is the Service delivered internally (to another Objective that needs it as input) or externally (to a Client).
- Activity: the Activity/Activities delivering the Service.
- Competitors: companies that offer similar or exactly the same Service.    
________________________________________
## Operations
Operations involves the performance of Processes through Resources (Staff, Assets and Suppliers) to deliver Results in the form of Services to ultimately yield Revenue. The Resources are funded by Liabilities and Equity. Combined Staff, Assets, Suppliers, Liabilities and Equity are what produces the embedded Processes that make up Operations through Run and Change.
Run and Change generate Cost and Risk, both undesired, but both also unavoidable.   
The so called Operating Model which is designed and maintained as part of Planning reflects the manner in which Operations are performed.   
Operations are the most work intense part of the Profile as it reflects actual work done to deliver the Services. Operations are dynamic in that they evolve over time under the direction of Management. Note that Operations is sometimes also deemed a Business Function.
  
Despite the conceptual simplicity of Operations, it is one of the most complex Profile Tree item. This complexity stems from the fact that depending on the Sector the Services are aimed at, the Processes involved will differ fundamentally. For example, the production of a Smartphone has completely different requirements than the production of tractors or the delivery of insurance Services. This complexity can be easily understood by studying standard academic literature on Operations Management like for example Slack, 2010. 
  
Key deliverables for Operations are its five outputs:
- Run
- Change
- Revenue
- Cost
- Risk

### Run
The so called Run, or Run The Organisation (RTO), a.k.a. Production or Prod, is composed of Routines done in a recurring or continuous manner and which generate Run Services. The name comes from the expression "Running a Business". Recurring can be continuously, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, two-yearly, ad-hoc (triggered), etc. Run is often broken down into two *chains*:
- The *Value Chain*: Processes directly or indirectly generating the Services that drive Revenue.
- The *Control Chain*: Processes assuring the quality of the Services delivered in the Value chain.

The Value Chain are the Routines that generate Services (directly or indirectly) that are sold to Clients. This should be seen very broadly. It includes everything from research and development, production of actual Goods or Services, marketing, sales, after sales.  
The Control Chain are those Routines that perform Services that verify the results of the Value Chain are as expected. Control should be seen broadly. For example, it could be a check of the product to make sure it features the expected qualities, on the other hand it can also conclude various measures taken to assure the Run itself was performed in a manner prescribed by the company or by some law or regulation.

### Change
Change, Change The Organisation (CTO) or Transformation, consists of all Processes performed to improve or transform the Run such as to:
- Grow output to yield more Revenue (more existing Services, new Services);
- Protect existing Revenue at risk of being lost;
- Secure the manner in which Services are produced to reduce Risk;
- Optimise the manner in which Services are produced to increase output at constant Cost, reduce Cost, reduce Risk or any combination of these.
  
Change is composed of Projects and performed within Activities by Groups and these Activities could be the same as the ones for the Run or different ones.
  
There is no fixed ratio between Run and Change for any given industry. At average, in the past it was more around 80% Run and 20% Change, over time this has shifted to 20/80. There are also extreme cases: some companies have an Operating Model based on custom made Products, effectively reducing Routines to nearly 0 and Projects to almost 100% of the modus operandi e.g., custom made furniture or cars. In some companies Operations is deemed Run including Projects. Furthermore, some Ventures operate according to varying models like Run-Grow-Transform. 
  
### Revenue
Revenue is the result of the Run. It explains how production and sales of Services or Products contribute to Income of the Venture. Understanding of Revenue drivers and its evolution and future expectations of Revenue is key to Management. 
Although the core activity of a Venture is to generate Revenue from the Run, other forms of Revenue can occur. For example the sale of an Activity may yield Revenue, but will also subsequently yield a loss of Revenue that Activity generated. Revenue is often net of Cost Of Good Sold or other contra revenues, see below.
  
### Cost
Operations creates Cost in different forms:
- Costs of Good Sold: costs directly related to the manufacturing of goods or delivery of Services a.k.a. Operating Fees, Negative Income (for Banks), Contra-Revenues. In other words: if a Service is not delivered, the cost is also not Incurred, at least in theory. In practice there are production timing considerations which require a purchase of Inventory to be used at one point in time in manufacturing, effectively yielding a Cost without yet having delivered a Product. Such inventory finds its way into the Balance Sheet as an Asset. It is also possible that certain of such Costs of Goods Sold relate to a minimum purchase by the Venture, and thus lead to more complex cost structures. Note that where a COGS, NNBI or Contra-Revenue is incurred, it is often recorded under Revenue (as a negative number).
- Operating Costs: costs required to keep Operations up and running, incl. Salaries, utilities, rent, licenses, subscriptions, depreciation, etc. These costs are incurred even if a Service is not delivered.
- Other Costs: these include one off costs like fines, impairments etc. 
  
Cost is an undesirable, but necessary deliverable, and its minimisation through Cost Management is an important output of Management. Cost is expressed in reporting currency on the Income Statement, but within Operations it can also be expressed and monitored via proxies like time, man-hours or man-days, head-count, etc. 
  
### Risk
Risk reflects the probability of adverse, unplanned -not necessarily unexpected- events that have an adverse outcome and that emerge as a result of Run and Change being performed in a dynamic Environment. 
  
More specifically, unplanned events occur as result of either: 
i) Weaknesses in Run and Change Processes performed or supported by Staff, Suppliers or Assets and/or   
ii) Unforeseen conditions created internally (Management, Staff, Suppliers, Assets) or externally (Suppliers, Clients, and Environment).
   
The adverse outcome can be:
- Decreased Revenue (Run stops, Services or Goods are destroyed)
- Increased Cost (cost of adding new Processes, new Staff or Assets, loss of Assets or Staff, fines, lawsuits, legal counsel, insurance, ...)
  
Note that in the definition of Risk, the definition of adverse outcome is left open to interpretation and ironically, is often also probabilistic. For example an unplanned event may be a critical high pressure hose break. This will definitely stop production for a while which means lack of Revenue (the adverse outcome), and the hose needs to be repaired which means in increased Cost (another adverse outcome). However, how long will the production stop, how much repair is needed? The answers to those questions is often probabilistic. Another case of the probabilistic aspect of adverse outcome is a breach of Regulation, without the actual breach having had any other adverse outcome e.g., a plane did not crash, but an airline company was found to not have complied with government requirements set out for maintenance (the unplanned event here is a lack of required maintenance). In this case, estimating the cost of lawyers the potential fine, is all the domain of probability. Note also, that the event itself in this case would materialise only by some form of internal or external control e.g., an audit.
  
Management of Operations invariably includes *mitigation* of Risk which consists of Processes put in place to pro-actively-identify zones of Risk and remediate the cause of that Risk. In the case of i) above, Risk Mitigation is often referred to as *Quality Control*, and for ii) it is referred to as *Risk Management*. These two terms are contextual and may this be used differently in different Ventures. Ultimately, Risk can be seen as a form of *probabilistic* Cost and the mitigation of Risk incurs a *realised* or *actual* Cost e.g., insurance, hedge transactions, backup Assets, more Staff than strictly necessary for the Run, disaster recovery drills, etc.
  
Several types of Risk exist:
- Strategic Risk: Managerial decisions yielding unexpected Results;
- Financial Risk: Market Risk, Credit Risk, Counterparty Risk, these are risk related to financial products or the solvency of clients involved in (financial) transactions This is very relevant for banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, asset managers, but also corporates that hedge their real world exposure with financial transactions;
- Operational Risk: risk that Operations yield unexpected Services or byproducts, or don't yield a Service at all, or alternatively result in damage to Resources including Staff (injuries), Assets or Suppliers. 
- Legal Risk: the risk of Operations not being conducted within the laws set out in a given country e.g., employment law.
- Regulatory Risk incl. Tax Risk: a sub-set of Legal Risk. Regulatory Risk is the risk that the Results yielded by Operations create a dispute with an authority (tax authority, regulator, ...) leading to or more Cost in the form of legal counsel fees, fines, loss of license to operate, etc. Regulatory Risk is specific to the Sector the Venture Operates in, whereas Legal Risk is often independent of such Business or Sector. 
- Reputational risk: a.k.a. Franchise Risk is the risk that the name, good standing, reputation of a Venture is damaged with the result that Clients seek their Services elsewhere. Reputational Risk can be as a result of the Venture itself, but also, indirectly as a result of the actions of one or more Staff in the Venture, or alternatively through Suppliers, indirectly because of the Sector the Venture operates in.  
- Actuarial Risk: specific to the insurance industry, actuarial risk involves the statistics involved in decision taking with regards to loss of life, loss of operations.
- Supply chain risk: concerns interruptions in supply chain either as physical disruption or changes in the cost of using existing supply chains. This could be simply the bankruptcy of a single Supplier, as well as geopolitical disruptions like war with a country that has Suppliers used by the Venture.    
- Cyber Risk: a rapidly evolving risk facing nearly all private and public institutions in the world. Various types of risk exist, of which the three most important ones are data theft, malware and ransomware. 
- Fraud: any form of deception to gain something unlawfully or at least unfairly, or to deprive an individual in the Venture or the entire Venture some legal right or commercial opportunity. 
- Other: there are Risks often specific to each industry e.g. in biotech the risk of a virus escaping, etc.
  
Risk is an undesirable consequence of conducting Operations and Management within a not controllable Environment. Its minimisation through Risk Management is an important responsibility of a Manager and expressed within the Goal  "Perform oversight". Risk is also the focus of certain Business Functions like Risk, Quality Assurance and Quality Control (different names, similar objective).  
It is important to note that depending on the Venture, Risk is fundamental or incidental to the Venture. For example, in Financial Institutions Risk is fundamental and the very active management of Risk is core throughout Operations. The same is true for pharmaceutical, airplane and car manufacturing companies for example. On the other hand for a small furniture manufacturer Risk is more incidental to Operations, and it can be -partially- managed through for example a simple Insurance. 
________________________________________
## Staff
Staff refers to people employed by the Venture i.e., employees, who are directly responsible for performing Objectives. Staff are grouped into Groups in which they have specific Roles and Responsibilities, which are defined in Organising. To fulfill these Roles & Responsibilities Staff need *Skills* and *Knowledge* which are confirmed through *Experience*. Staff is managed on a day to day basis through Leading. The Business Function Human Resources aids Managers in various aspects of Staff like recruitment, training, salary, etc. 
  
Key deliverables for Staff are:
- Skills
- Knowledge
- Experience
  
It is important to see that these deliverables are very much focused on the deliverables towards the Venture. From the Staff perspective, there are a broad possible range of considerations for them to be part of the Venture like job satisfaction, salary, etc. They are not considered properties of Staff, and are considered as deliverables of Business Function Human Resources. 

### Skills
A Skill is defined as the learned ability to perform a Process such that the expected Result is yielded within the constraints and dependencies imposed on the execution of said Process within a Responsibility. Skills are more focused on "doing something". Skills are acquired through study and practice either through doing it at home or club, in a classroom setting (school, university, evening school) or on-the-job training. 
  
### Knowledge
Knowledge refers to what is required in understanding topics involved in the Responsibility and is thus more focused on "understanding something". Knowledge can be obtained through self-study, classroom setting or on the job-training.
  
### Experience
Skills and Knowledge can often be 'proven' or 'benchmarked' from having performed similar Roles and Responsibilities which is referred to as Experience. Experience thus gives more weight to the relevance of Skills and Knowledge. Experience is often expressed as "Similar role for X years in Y type of company".

Additional Staff Properties
Staff may have various properties that within the context of a Venture are relevant:
- Internal/External: is Staff internal (employee) or external (temp staff, contractor, consultant).
- Overview: description which can include aspects like how the Staff got to join the Venture etc,.
- Manager: whom the Staff reports to 
- Category: often the corporate title which is also used for Evaluation, see below.
- Group: which Group the Staff belongs to. The Group gives the Staff an identity within the Venture and indicates the type of work. 
- Job Description: the type of work the Staff is expected to perform see [## Roles & Responsibilities]. 
- Training: the training record of Staff, including before and during the Venture. Training aims at increasing Skills. The Process involved in Training sits under Human Resources, see [## Human Resources].
- Evaluation: reviews of the Staff's performance in achieving the Objectives, be they individual or collective. Evaluation feeds Remuneration. The Process involved in Evaluation sits under Human Resources, see [## Human Resources].
- Remuneration: the recurring Cost of Staff, which includes salary but also secondary forms of remuneration like health insurance, social security, retirement, holidays etc. The Process involved in Remuneration sits under Human Resources, see [## Human Resources]. Although this item may not be recorded directly on the Staff, the details need to be collected so they can be used in Budgeting which is part of Planning. Bonus is part of remuneration but is not shown as a recurring Cost. 
________________________________________
## Assets
Assets refers to the setup available to Staff, and Suppliers, to perform Operations, including the financial means (Cash) to acquire those Assets. Assets can be tangible and intangible. For the purpose of the Management Framework, a tangible asset is a physical item including land, building, vehicle, furniture, fixings, server, PC, laptop, cash, receivables, etc. An intangible asset is a non-physical item that has a multi-period useful life like patents, copyrights, client lists, trademarks, brand names, logos, procedures, data, referential data, Special Purpose Vehicles, as well as knowledge which is developed over time through training, experience and recruitment etc.
Note that not all intangible assets in this framework can be found on the balance sheet e.g., referential data, procedures or knowledge. Assets are for a large part managed through Business Function e.g. Finance or through dedicated Activities (see below). Assets often have a dependency on Suppliers which service them.  
As mentioned, Assets includes Cash made available through Funding, or the sale of Services.  
A special type of Asset is *Legal Entity*, which is managed by Business Function CorpSec.  
  
The scope of Assets in the Profile is broader than in Business Function Finance (see below). In Finance, *only* those resources owned by the Venture *and* which can be converted to Cash are deemed Assets and will appear on the Balance Sheet. As such, there needs to be a reasonable method to give a monetary value to such Assets. Any such item not deemed an Asset for the Balance Sheet is either an *off-balance sheet* item or is simply not considered at all. For example, in the Profile a procedure *is* an Asset but in Finance it is not always e.g., the Coca-Cola recipe would be an Asset for the Balance Sheet (goodwill), but the procedure how to clean the drums in which that drink is mixed is not and would not even be recorded under off-balance sheet assets.      
It is possible to hear the term human capital, or "our assets are our staff,", which suggests Staff could be some form of Asset. The Management Framework explicitly makes distinction between the two and thus does not include Staff within Assets. 
   
Key deliverables for Assets are:
- Accounting Assets incl. Cash
- Infrastructure
- Intangibles
- Data
  
### Accounting Assets incl. Cash
Accounting Assets are those assets officially maintained in accounting records (Balance Sheet) including *Fixed assets*, e.g. buildings and machinery as well as *Current Assets* e.g., Receivables as well as *Cash*. Cash is used to fund ongoing *Operating Costs* i.e. rent, raw material, utilities, etc. It is also used to purchase Infrastructure. Cash is made available from ongoing sales of Services and financing, see [## Finance].
  
### Infrastructure
Infrastructure or Infra a.k.a. systems, refers to the physical setup used on a day to day basis whether part of Accounting Assets or not (off-balance sheet). Infra is purchased from Suppliers using Cash. The term is used mostly in non-manufacturing Sectors in which case it refers to IT infrastructure (PC, servers, software).

### Intangibles
This includes all those intangible assets like procedures, referential, etc that are not Accounting Assets.

### Data
The terms *Data* and *Information* a.k.a. *Info* are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same. Data in the Management Framework is defined as individual facts, while Information is the organisation, interpretation and visualisation of those facts within a relevant context.
Data is also an intangible Asset, but has its own classification given its importance. Data is technically a combination of a physical repository (classified under Infrastructure) and the content held therein. Content can be broken down into two key types: *Structured Data* (spreadsheets, databases,...), and *Unstructured Data* (videos, music, pictures, text, presentations, source code,...).   
Neither Data nor Information yield truth (an accurate reflection of reality) as such, because both can be subjectively produced (Harari, 2024). However, this document will not enter that philosophical debate and stick to the simple premise that Managers have an interest to produce Data and Information that is as accurate as possible, and we also assume that Managers do this in the best interest of the Venture, see also, [### Agency Problem].  
    
### Services
This refers to Services provided by Suppliers and which are not any of the above e.g., trading venues. For such Services which are not recognised as an Asset on the Balance Sheet, although a fee is most likely charged, so they would create a Cost. From an Operations perspective such Services are an Asset as they enable the Operations to be performed.  
   
For each Asset in above key deliverables the following aspects can be relevant: 
- Type: whether the Asset is serviced/procured internally (Internal Supplier) or externally (external Supplier).
- Overview: description which can include aspects like history.
- Category: the category of the Asset (software, hardware, documentation, toolkit, ...).
- Supplier: name of the Supplier(s) servicing the Asset.
- Output: he output(s) of the Asset, i.e., what does it do.
- Cost: Cost per year. This  includes recurring license fees, support fees but not one-off fees which should be captured under Project Costs. Cost details are used in budgeting which is part of Financial Planning. 
________________________________________
## Suppliers
Suppliers contribute to the performance of Operations without being accountable for it. Suppliers can be embedded, internal or external (see below). They include but are not limited to distributors, utilities as well as internal departments /groups /teams. Suppliers can provide raw materials, finished products, commodities like electricity, water as well as intangibles e.g., custody, advisory, etc. Suppliers are closely linked to Assets as they often provide and/or service Assets. The definition is thus very broad e.g., a company's legal entities used as Special Purpose Vehicles are considered Suppliers as they own and service the SPV. Suppliers can also provide services to Management, although in that case they are covered under Business Functions.
   
There are two types of Suppliers: *Internal Suppliers* and *External Suppliers*:
- Internal Suppliers: Suppliers within the same Venture. This is the case where there is a department or team that is deemed a Supplier to other Activities within the Venture. 
- External Suppliers: these are the 'classic' Suppliers outside the Venture and included a vast array of Suppliers.

Other names for Suppliers are *Service Provider*, *Solution Provider*, or *Support Function*.

The word Supplier is sometimes interchanged with *Business Partner* or *Partner*. Although Suppliers and Partners both offer Services to a Venture there is a difference which lies in the *relationship* with the Venture. Suppliers provide Services based on a bidding process and for a specific purpose e.g., buying furniture, after which the relationship often ceases to exist until it is required again. Partners, on the other hand, work with Management to optimise Operations such as to achieve the best Services. The relationship with Partners is long-lasting and based on *trust* in addition to the commercial terms. The word Supplier is used throughout this Profile to reflect either.  
  
Key aspects for Suppliers are:
- Internal/External: whether the Supplier is an internal Supplier or not. 
- Overview: description which can include aspects like history, Environment, etc.
- Category: the category of the Supplier (provision of Assets, Services or both)
- Output: Services provided by the Supplier:
    - Knowledge or know-how e.g. Accounting, Legal, etc.  
    - Products: raw materials, half- or fully finished products 
    - A combination of above
- Cost: the Cost per year. This includes license fees, support fees.
________________________________________
## Liabilities 
In order to pay for its Resources (Staff, Assets and Suppliers) the Venture needs Cash. Cash is often not available the moment it is required, and overcoming the timing differences between needing Cash and Cash being generated from Revenue, the Venture can take on so called Liabilities. Liabilities are recorded on the Balance Sheet and are maintained through Business Function Finance.
  
Liabilities can take various forms:  
- Short term loans  
- Purchases on credit  
- Prepayments 
- Bank overdrafts  
- Long term loans   
- Bond Issuance  
  
The result of taking on Liabilities is the Asset Cash which then is used to pay for those Resources. Alternatively a Liability is a deferred Expense (avoidance of Cash consumption now but instead delayed to a later moment in time). The processes involved in assuring Cash is available or not needing to be consumed now, are referred to as Funding or Financing, see also [### Financing].
________________________________________
## Equity
The difference between Assets and Liabilities represents the net worth of the Venture. For non-listed companies i.e., sole-proprietorship this net-worth is often called Capital. If a Venture has issued Shares through an incorporation process the term Equity is used instead of Capital.  
The notion of Capital or Equity, is important and used in many different manners. In all cases, the underlying concepts are similar: it is the Net Worth of a Venture capable of generating further Profit as well as capable of absorbing losses. 
The former can be achieved by reinvesting Profit in one or more aspects of the Operations, thus generating more Revenue (reduction of Cost is possible too). Losses can be absorbed by eating into reserves, suspending dividend payments or writing down equity (Choudhry, 2012).  
In the capital structure, the rights of capital creditors, including equity holders, are
subordinated to senior creditors and deposit holders. A capital base that is
not sufficient to absorb losses and still maintains the viability of the bank as a
going concern is inadequate and not fit for purpose and will face bankruptcy.
  
Equity has several types:
- Preferred Stock
- Shares issued a.k.a. Common Stock
- Retained Earnings
- Reserves 

### Preferred Stock
Shares issues that rank before Common stock, but after Bonds in case of bankruptcy. They pay dividends, but offer no voting rights.

### Common Stock
Common stock represents basic ownership in a Corporation. It is the residual corporate interest that bears the ultimate risk of loss, as it is subordinate to all preferred stock. Common stock gives voting rights to the holders.

### Retained Earnings
Retained earnings represent the portion of Net Income that has been reinvested  into the business rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends. On the Balance Sheet it reperesents the amount of profits a company has accumulated over time and has chosen to keep, rather than paying out. 

### Reserves
Reserves represent a portion of earnings that are set aside for future use, most often for a specific purpose. There are several types of Reserves possible:
  
- Revenue Reserves: created from Operations
- Capital Reserves: created from Capital transactions e.g., sale of shares above par value.   
- Legal Reserves: a buffer to be set aside under some law 
- General Reserves: a general buffer not for a specific purpose
   
The Processes involved in issuing Shares is discussed in Financing, see [### Financing]. More generally speaking, a Manager, in particular at higher levels, are expected to understand the relationship between Assets, Liabilities, Equity and Profitability as well as the different forms of Equity and how they help maintain a financially healthy Venture.
________________________________________
## Management
Management, or Managing, focuses on a person, called *Manager*, proactively using Tools to continuously fund, enable and deploy Resources at a Cost to assure the continuous production, oversight *and* improvement of Operations in order for Services to be delivered to Clients yielding Revenue despite constraints emanating from the Environment.   
The above summary is essentially an alternative view of the Profile. To achieve it, Management consists of continuously and interchangeably performing four *Management Functions* called *Planning*, *Organising*, *Leading* and *Controlling* or *POLC* (Rutter, 2003), (Loyd et al, 2020), (University of Ohio, 2010), (Poff et al, 2023).   
Whereas the POLC are commonly understood to constitute the four core functions a Manager performs, the amount of time spent on each, as well as the detail required to be covered can vary depending on the Venture. The Profile aims at defining these four functions more holistically such that it provides more guidance to Managers in the context of the overall structure of a Venture.
  
Management As Goal
As was discussed in the Profile Overview, Management is one of the four key Run Goals of a Venture. It makes sense to have Management central to the Goals of a Company, as without Management the Venture will not sustain. 
  
Management and Resources
In the Profile Tree, there is no mention of Staff, Assets, or Suppliers under Management. Yet, Management is performed by Staff, requires certain Assets, and often Suppliers are used. Although Management consumes certainly some assets, it is minor compared to the Asset consumption in Operations. Assets that are specific to Management are the Tools. Lastly, Suppliers for Management are effectively the Business Functions.   
    
Management vs Governance
Often the term Governance is used separately from, or in combination with, Management. Depending on the context used they mean different things. These different interpretations can be expressed as function of one or more Management Functions, or specific deliverables within the Management Functions. Below follow two cases, but other interpretations are possible:
- Scholarly view : 
    - Governance = Planning + Organising  
    - Management = Leading + Controlling  
- Risk view: 
    - Governance = Planning + Controlling  
    - Management = Organising + Leading  

The distinction between Governance and Management is not relevant for the Management Framework: Management is holistic, all-encompassing, as discussed above. It is, however, important to recognise that some Ventures make such distinction.
  
Management vs Leadership  
From a definition perspective, Management is sometimes seen solely as consisting of Planning, Organising and Controlling the Venture's Suppliers, Assets and Staff to accomplish the Goals, whereas Leadership refers to an individual's ability to direct, inspire, influence, motivate, and enable Staff to contribute toward those Goals. In short, the main difference between the two is that leadership is about influencing Staff to follow, while Management focuses on maintaining systems and processes. As can be seen from the POLC, Leading or leadership is a fundamental aspect of Management and as such, Management and Leading are thus entirely intertwined in the Profile. Note that one can be good in the POC of Management but not in the L, which makes a less effective Leader. Reversely, a good Leader may not be an efficient Manager.
  
Management Level   
As explained above, a Venture can be at various levels. A *Management Level* indicates at what level within the organisation Management is performed. 
Top Management is Management of the entire Venture often represented through so called *C-suite* roles (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc) particularly if it is a listed company or an incorporated company. Middle Management involves running Activities on department level, whereas Low-level Management or Line Management relates to teams. Obviously, many more Management Levels are possible. Ultimately, Top Management delegates (see [## Organising]) a vast amount of Management Functions to Middle Management and they in turn delegate to Line Management. At each level Management still consists of the Four Management Functions, but the lower the level, the more the functions focus on Short Term and Operational aspects and less on Strategic aspects.   
Note also that for lower levels Management itself is not a full time job, instead it is part of the job, and the Manager may be involved in the Operations. This is referred to as a *hybrid Management/Operations* role or a *Hybrid Manager*. In addition, the concepts of Management can also be used by Directors of the board, see under [## Venture].
    
Academic View on Management   
Management has, and still is, the topic of much study. The Management Framework does not intent to reflect the vast amount of work done over the last 100 years. For example, Henry Fayol defined five instead of four Management Functions. The fifth one, Coordinating, does not appear as such in the Management Framework and has over time been morphed into the other Management Functions.more importantly, whereas early Management focused solely on the point of view of the Venture, modern Management theory has a strong focus on the interest of Staff whose reasons to work are not purely economical. 
  
Management has the following deliverables:  
- Management Cycle a.k.a. MC 
- Management Improvement a.k.a. MI
- Planning
- Organising
- Leading
- Controlling
   
The latter four are effectively what Management is composed of from a modern academic view, and have their own dedicated section below. These six deliverables are also considered the Sub-Goals of Management.
  
### Management Cycle
As mentioned before, the *monetary output* of Operations is Revenue, and the *monetary input* is Cost (of Staff, Assets and Suppliers), with a collateral *monetary output* being Risk, and this is funded by monetary inputs Cash, Liabilities and Equity. These three outputs (Revenue, Cost, Risk) are the Manager's main, albeit high-level gauges for success of Operations. They are in turn generated by the Run of Operations, and that Run is subsequently improved by Change, all driven and overseen by Management. These aspects of the Profile Tree, are what make up the Management Cycle, and each aspect is referred to as a Cycle: 
  
0. Management  
This baseline cycle represents all aspects of the Profile other than the 6 items below. This cycle is used to initiate a so called *Management Structure* i.e., the total of Tools and Processes the Manager uses to discharge his duties. It is effectively this cycle that is concerned with Staff, Suppliers, Assets as well as all the Business Functions.
  
1. Revenue (or alternatively Income Statement)  
The Revenue cycle aims at collecting Revenue data and use it to assess the Revenue generating capacity of Operations. Alternatively, for higher level Managers, this cycle may focus on the Income Statement i.e., Revenue *and* Cost with the second Management Cycle being focused on the Balance Sheet, see also the cycle below.
  
2. Cost (or alternatively Balance Sheet)  
The Cost cycle aims at collecting Cost data and use it to assess the Cost consumption within Operations. Alternatively, for Higher Level Managers this cycle focuses on the Balance Sheet (Assets, Liabilities and Equity which in turns allows focusing on KPIs like Capital Ratios, Equity, RWA, Inventory KPIs etc. 
  
3. Risks  
The Risk cycle aims at collecting Risk related data and use it to assess how Risk is  generated within Operations as well as within the Services produced by Operations. This cycle also includes Risk mitigation through Controls. 
  
4. Run   
The Run cycle involves everything related to Run Goals and Routines performed within the Activities that make up Operations. This can involve anything from a detailed list of Goals and Routines a.k.a. *Run Inventory* or a higher level description of Activities.
  
5. Change  
The Change cycle involves everything related to Change Goals and Projects performed within the Activities that make up Operations. This often involves anything the detailed list of Goals and Projects a.k.a. *Roadmap*.
  
6. Intel  
The Intel cycle a.k.a. Alert, Attention, collects internal and external knowledge. It is effectively a rather broad cycle and can include anything from Bylaws to competitor analysis to rumours. It is  the only cycle within the MC that is not explicitly part of the Profile Tree, but given the dependency of the Manager on Intel, it is integral and explicit part of the MC. 
  
### Management Improvement 
The aim of Management is to maintain and improve Operations. In order to maximise the result and efficiency of this, Management itself requires constant improvement: Management Improvement or *MI*. This deliverable puts the onus on Managers to continuously learn about the Profile (Venture specific) and Management Theory in general. Management Theory is a vast topic that continuously grows, and Managers are expected to stay informed of this within the context of the Venture they work in.   
________________________________________
## Planning
Planning involves Processes to establish *what is to be done, where, when and why* and also *how*. It is one of the most holistic Functions within Management. It is forward looking In its approach.
  
This Management Function continuously defines why the Venture exists and which Services need to be delivered now and in the future, in which location and for which Clients as well as how this needs to be achieved. 

The following are the fifteen deliverables of Planning:
- Context 
- Purpose
- Vision
- Mission
- Values
- Bylaws
- SWOT
- Goals (K)
- Objectives (K)
- Tasks
- Benchmark
- Strategic Plan
- Tactical Plan 
- Operational Plan
- Intel

### Context
The Context a.k.a. *Business Model* gives the Manager visibility on what the Venture is about, or said differently, what the *Value Proposition* i.e., what aspect(s) about the Service(s), or the way Operations are performed, are a differentiator for Clients. A key input to the Context is the result of SWOT (see below). Managers spend considerable time on assuring they know ins and outs of the Venture, constantly collecting information through Management Functions and Business Functions such that a holistic insight can be obtained and formalised in the Business Model. Note that a Business Model is related to, but not the same as *Operating Model* or Operational Plan, which is explained further below.

### Purpose
A Purpose Statement articulates the *why* of the Venture *now*. It explains the reason of its existence and the impact it wants to make, or in other words, what it does beyond the generation of Profit, *today*. Most Ventures actually do not use Purpose Statements, and they focus on Vision Statements, or they use a Purpose Statement which is really a Vision Statement.

### Vision
A Vision Statement expresses the *why* of the Venture in the *future*. It explains what it thinks the reason of its existence should be and the impact it should have, or in other words, what it should do beyond a generation of Profit, *tomorrow*. 

They are often of the form:

    To *verb* *object*

which is short for: 

    "Our purpose is to verb object."

Sometimes the verb object pattern is repeating.

Examples (company name, company type):
- To improve the world through trust (Everledger, Technology)
- To make active goals accessible (Sporting Wheelies, Disability Services)
- To simplify technology to empower business (Over the wire, Communications)
- To connect patients to advancements in cancer care (Icon Cancer Foundation, Healthcare)

### Mission
A Mission Statement expresses *how* the Venture achieves the Purpose in the following manner:

    "Achieve X by doing Y for the benefit of Z"
    in which:
    X: What (type of) Services get delivered
    Y: How are they delivered (differentiating factors)
    Z: Whom receives the benefits: Clients or Stakeholders

The most important one is Y as that sets the Venture apart from Competitors. The differentiating factors can be related to the Service itself (quality, availability, aesthetics, taste, ...), the cost to the Client, or it can be more focused on how the Service is produced (environmentally friendly, with involvement of the Client, etc).

### Values
Values reflect what the Venture deems its moral or cultural compass. It can be composed of Values *and* Principles. These are somewhat different in what they mean. Values focus on how to 'be' whereas principles focus on how to 'act' or what to do. Values are opinions and ideas and are thus subjective, and as a result, they can change under different conditions. Principles govern interactions between people, but are objective. 
  
Values and Principles affect the Venture as a whole and each individual working within or for it like Suppliers. They also set requirements in terms of recruitment. The distinction between Values and Principles may not be made in each company.
  
Examples for LinkedIn:
    - Members first
    - Relationships matter
    - Be open, honest, and constructive 
    - Inspire excellence
    - Take intelligent risks
    - Act like an owner of #OneLinkedIn
    - Embody diversity, inclusion, and belonging

### Bylaws
Bylaws represent a broad range of texts that frame the *conditions* under which the Venture *must* operate and how it *must* organise itself. Bylaws represent the Venture's interpretation of laws, rules, regulations and guidelines imposed by the Environment and which effectively provide *boundaries* on Services and on how Operations can be performed. They result from the fact that the Venture operates directly or indirectly in one or more Countries or Sectors that are heavily regulated globally and/or nationally. In addition, Ventures can themselves define rules with regards to what it deems the Venture should comply with even if this is not mandated by any official institution. Often, such Venture imposed rules will also embody the Values mentioned above. The definition of Bylaws is a result from the SWOT process, see below.
  
Examples of Bylaws are Articles of Association, Company Laws, Company Policies, Company Rules, Normative Documentation, etc.  
  
Obtaining knowledge, and interpretation of applicable laws, rules and regulations is part and parcel of Bylaws. This is often achieved through the Business Functions:
- Compliance: regulations specific to the Services delivered or to the type of Venture 
- Risk: specific regulations w/r to Risk if applicable 
- CorpSec - Legal: corporate law 
- CorpSec - Tax: tax law, applicable to Profit and Salaries
- Human Resources: employment law
- Finance: Financial reporting standards, capital requirements
  
It is up to Management to assure Objectives are implemented such that they comply with Bylaws.
  
### SWOT
A SWOT, or *Impact Assessment* reviews all internal aspect of the Venture (Operations, Management and their respective deliverables including Services) versus external forces (Clients, Suppliers, Environment and their respective deliverables) to assess to what extent the Venture's *internal* *Strengths* and *Weaknesses* combined with *external* *Threats* and *Opportunities* make the Mission achievable, or more generally enable the increase of Revenue, decrease of Cost and of Risk in a sustainable manner.  
SWOT is an important deliverable for a Manager as it allows to define how to adjust the Venture to avoid or counter Threats and to take advantage of Opportunities given the Venture's Strengths and Weaknesses.  
The key inputs to a SWOT are the Operational Plan (or less holistically the Tactical or Strategic Plan) and Intel (both discussed below).   
SWOT feeds into the definition of Sub-Goals and Projects (see below) to seize Opportunities and/or remediate Weaknesses in Routines. Additionally, a SWOT can yield changes in deliverables of the other Management Functions (Organising, Leading and Controlling). The SWOT also feeds Context (see above). SWOT is most impactful when performed as a *continuous process*. 
Note that SWOT is also the name of a well known Management Tool for assessing how a Venture is doing. However, in the Profile, SWOT is the name given to *any* process or framework assessing the impact of forces from outside or inside the Venture and the manner in which the Venture adapts to said forces through Management. 
  
### Goals 
Goals are outcome statements that define how the Venture is trying to accomplish its Mission and how it tries to align the Mission to the Vision over time. Goals are most often expressed in terms of Revenue, Cost and Risk, and thus indirectly the Services it aims to deliver through Operations. Goals are an intrinsic part of the RPT, see [### Reduced Profile Tree], and are the overarching driver for Objectives. 
  
Goals have the following properties:
1. Clear and unambiguous description of target
2. Measurable
3. Linked to Mission, Purpose and Vision
4. Specify period over which the Goal applies -mostly indefinitely-
  
Goals, like Services, differentiate between *Run Goals* and *Change Goals*:
  
#### Run Goals 
Run Goals relate to Run Services and are expressed in Revenue, Cost and Risk targets. They constitute, in most cases, the vast majority of work performed in Operations. Run Goals drive Run Objectives. Standard Run Goals in most Ventures are: 
1. Manage the Venture (Management or mgt); 
2. Produce the Run Services (Production or prd); 
3. Oversee Production, a.k.a. Quality/Risk Control (Oversight or ovs); and 
4. Perform Overhead (or ovh), an effort not contributing to any of the above.

NB: Oversight follows the same concepts as in Controlling, and as such can be considered a form of delegation of Controlling, see [#### Delegating]

#### Change Goals 
Change Goals relate to Change Services. Change Goals drive Change Objectives and aim at improving the Run Goals. Standard Change Goals in most Ventures are: 
1. Grow Revenue (gro);
2. Protect existing Revenue from changes in the Environment (pro);
3. Secure Operations to reduce Risk (sec); and 
4. Optimise Operations to reduce Cost/Risk and/or increase Revenue (opt). 
  
For both Run and Change Goals alternatives exist and Managers can fill in such Goals any way they seem fit. However, above Goals are fundamental in how to approach any Venture.
  
Some Ventures have a catch all Default Change Sub-Goal:
5. Projects not specifically defined under 1-4 (prj).
  
#### Sub-Goals
Sub-Goals can be defined for both Run and Change Goals. Run Sub-Goals regroup Objectives that contribute directly or indirectly to one or more specific Services and can thus reflect specific Activities. Change Sub-Goals can be used as themes Management wants to focus on over a short period of time see [### Tactical Plan]. Change Sub-Goals are often presented in much detail to Stakeholders as part of the Strategy. The definition and maintenance of Sub-Goals is done as a result of SWOT. In the sections below, if *Goal* is mentioned, it can also mean Sub-Goal. 
  
##### Run Sub-Goals
The following represent default Run Sub-Goals for each of the 4 Run Goals. 
  
Goal = mgt
The Sub-Goals for Goal mgt are in most cases the six deliverables of Management mentioned earlier:
- Management Cycle
- Management Improvement
- Planning
- Organising
- Leading
- Controlling
  
Run Goal = prd
The following are classic un Sub-Goals for Run Goal prd:
- Activity X: regroups all Routines performed within a specific Activity. There are as many such Sub-Goals as there are Activities in the Venture. 
- Staff Maintenance
- Asset Maintenance
- Supplier Maintenance
- Service Maintenance, including Marketing
- Client Maintenance
- Environment Maintenance
- Revenue Maintenance
- Cost Maintenance
- Business Continuity (Routines to continue all other prd Sub-Goals in case of a disruption or more broadly a disaster). 
- Production Reporting (of all aspects related to Production to Stakeholders)
- Continuous improvement (small Project performed within Production)
- Research & Development (used mostly in manufacturing, leads to Change) 
- Production Support
  
In which: Maintenance is a catch-all for: implementation, on/off-boarding, integration, update, purchase and/or disposal of the Sub-Goal topic. It can include validation workflow, referential updates, software configurations, documentation, meetings in relation to the topic, etc. Maintenance could be construed as Change and not Run. The difference is subtle, and at the discretion of the Manager. In most cases, if maintenance is rather small compared to the resulting Growth of Revenue or decrease in Cost, decrease in Risk then it is deemed Run.
    
The last Sub-Goal, Production Support, is typically used for roles within an Activity that are a direct support to, without being accountable for Production, but also not being considered a Supplier e.g., Business Managers, COOs, Function Support, Team Support, Trade Support, Business Support, etc. Often, this Sub-Goal embeds interaction with the Business Functions, and potentially performance of processes related to such Business Functions. Production Support cannot perform, or assist in, any Routine of an Activity, but can assist in any of the other Sub-Goals. It is possible that there are as many Production Support Sub-Goals as there are Activities, which is the case if each Activity has a dedicated Support. Note that It is possible that the various Maintenance Sub-Goals in prd are owned by Suppliers. 
  
Run Goal = ovs
The following are typical Sub-Goals for Run Goal ovs:
- Attend: prepare, attend and/or minute a meeting to perform a Review (see below) in relation to data from Operations a.k.a. Committee, see [## Committee]
- Audit: verify independently data from Operations and/or Management against a benchmark determined most often as part of the audit itself
- Check: verify data from Operations against a formal benchmark
- Review: verify and/or validate data from Operations against an opinion of an experienced individual
- Oversight Reporting: report on all aspects related to Oversight to Stakeholders
- Oversight Support: maintenance of Routines supporting the above Sub-Goals within one or more Activities.

The notion of *data from Operations* includes qualitative and/or quantitative data from production (Results, Processes) either in isolation or as one or more Activities, including data of Staff, Assets, Suppliers, Services and/or Clients and including/against an assessment of the Environment. The first four Sub-Goals represent the Supervisory Processesl found in Controlling. Each of those Sub-Goals can yield weaknesses or possibility of improvement that can be addressed through a Project (Change). 
Oversight Sub-Goals may be defined across the Venture and/or for each Activity (most organisations).
The last Sub-Goal, Oversight Support, is typically used for roles within an Activity that are a direct support to Oversight, without being accountable for Oversight.

Run Goal = ovh
The following are often seen Sub-Goals for Run Goal ovh:
- Training: on the job training, safety/regulatory training, external training etc.
- Evaluation: definition of yearly personal objectives, evaluation against those objectives, compensation discussions, etc.
- Admin: company questionnaires, company initiatives for charity/sustainability/etc., holiday planning, etc.
- Legacy: Staff working on transferring knowledge to a replacement or covering Roles & Responsibilities for previous work
-  One-off: any work done for (small) Projects that are neither change nor Continuous Improvement under prd 
- Info: attend town halls/fireside chats, read emails, etc. on topics unrelated to any of the other Sub-Goals in prd, ovs, ovh, mgt. 

For default Change Goal prj there are dedicated Sub-Goals as well. They are standardised so the Roadmap can focus on gro, pro, sec, opt:
  
Change Goal = prj
The following are Sub-Goals for Change Goal prj:
- prj - gro: projects related to Revenue growth
- prj - pro: projects related to Revenue protection
- prj - sec: projects related to securing Operations
- prj - opt: projects related to Revenue growth, Cost Reduction
  
### Objectives  
Whereas a Goal is broad, an Objective is a precise, time-based Process, or set of Processes, the output of which is measurable and which supports the delivery of a Service and thus contributes to the completion of a Goal.
Objectives consume Assets and Suppliers and are performed, or at least initiated by Staff. An Objective is performed within an Activity and they play a key role in the RPT, see [### Reduced Profile Tree].

Objectives are defined by the 6Ws as follows:
1. What: Unambiguous and measurable, reflected by the name of the Objective.
2. When: have a *Start* and *End* date or *Recurrence* and an expected *Effort* and/or expected *Time to Market*.
3. Who: performed by a Staff/Group *and* for the benefit of an Activity, see [## Organising].
4. Why: linked to a Goal i.e., what is the aim of the Objective.
5. How: detailed Processes involved in achieving the Objective.
  
The *Where* aspect is relevant for Venture's where the delivery of Service is not the same as where the Clients are, or where Assets used in Operations are not in the same location as the Venture. If this is not relevant, the *where* can be defaulted to the Venture's or Activity's location. 
  
Objectives are either *Routines* or *Projects*. Both are Measurable and both also have a notion of *Effort*, or time spent involved in performing them, but they differ in property nr. 2: Projects are *limited* in time, whereas Routines are *recurring* in time. And of course fundamentally Projects aim to improve Routines.
  
#### Routines
Routines are composed of one or more Processes performed on a periodic basis that contribute to a Run Goal by virtue of them being performed periodically. Routines do not have an End Date and are thus never completed, even if the Process(es) the Routines are composed of do complete each time the Routine is performed. The periodicity can be short term (minutes, hours, days), medium (weeks, months) to long (quarters, years) or ad hoc i.e., they start when a trigger event occurs e.g., request.
  
Once a Routine is started it can take seconds to several weeks or even months to complete. Effectively, in certain cases Routines can behave like Projects in that they have a start date (trigger date) and an end-date (completion date). For example, a custom production company (custom car, custom furniture, etc.) will take several weeks if not months to design and build i.e., behaves like a Project potentially including a Plan, resource allocation etc. What sets Routines apart from Projects is that the former are part of the Run, i.e., the Revenue generating cycle, whereas Projects are part of Change.
  
Routines can be broken down into one or more *Subs* (sub-routines) which each can be further broken down into one or more *Drills*. Drills thus link to Subs and Subs link to Routines. This allows building a hierarchy as follows:
  
Venture
    Run Goal
        Run Sub-Goal    
            Routine
                Sub
                    Drill
  
Such *Routine Hierarchy* enables a detailed level of Planning where desired (which also means more maintenance). 
  
#### Projects 
Projects are composed of one or more Processes that contribute to Change Goals by being performed as a one-off. They start at one point in time and complete by an end date. The aim of Projects is to change the Run in one of two manners:
- Add new Routines to the Run (scope Change)
- Alter existing Routines to make the Run efficient (efficiency Change). Efficiency leads to improved Services and/or reduced Assets and/or reduced Suppliers and/or reduced Staff and/or reduced Effort. These reductions can be achieved through:
    - Deleting Processes or entire Routines
    - Automating Processes in Routines
    - Centralise Processes for several Routines
    - Simplify Processes in Routines
  
Note that for a Process, or group of Processes, to be considered a Project it needs to effectively change the Run. Work asked to be done at one point but which does not factually change the Run is actually a Routine with an ad-hoc trigger date, even if it occurs only once.
  
Projects can be further broken down into one or more *Streams* which each can be broken down into one or more *Actions*. Actions thus link to Streams and Streams link to Projects. This allows building a hierarchy as follows:
  
Venture
    Change Goal
         Change Sub-Goal
            Project
                Stream
                    Action
  
Such a *Project Hierarchy* enables a detailed level of Planning where desired (which also means more maintenance). 
  
Goals (incl Sub-Goals) and Objectives combined serve to:
1. Gauge and report performance
2. Drive and improve performance
3. Align effort across the Venture, and
4. Manage accountability within the Venture. 
  
The definition of, and change in, Goals (incl Sub-Goals) and Objectives as well as Management in general are a consequence of SWOT.
  
NB: Services, Vision, Mission, Goals and Objectives are intertwined: setting Goals and Objectives defines the Services that will be delivered. In fact Goals are expressed as the performance of specific Objectives to achieve those Services. On the other hand Services that should be delivered are shaped by Clients which in turn drive the Mission from which follow Goals and Objectives, as it drives the longer term Vision.
  
### Tasks
Tasks are similar to Objectives but on a smaller scale i.e., there are Tasks that are more like Routines and Tasks that are more like Projects. Tasks can also be used to reflect specific Processes within Routines or Projects and/or Subs/Drills, Streams/Actions and are thus an efficient manner to keep track of progress within Objectives without necessarily breaking those down in Subs/Streams and Drills/Actions. 
Alternatively, Tasks can also reflect work to do without being specific on whether it is an Objective or whether it is part of a Goal or whether it contributes to a Service. Effectively, Tasks are then a catch-all for "things to do" without the formalism of Objectives. They do not need to be defined for a Venture to exist, but they may help defining smaller scale Ventures or Activities within Ventures. 
  
### Benchmark
Planning defines *metrics* that express *criteria* to assess if, and how well, an Objective, Sub-Goal, Goal of the Strategy was achieved. Such metrics are referred to as Benchmark and they are used in Controlling to establish whether the Planning yielded the expected results.
  
Benchmarks come in a wide range of types. Below often used ones:
  
- KPI: Key Performance Indicator. A metric used for Revenue, Cost and Balance Sheet tracking. However, it can also measure aspects indirectly related to these monetary deliverables, but rather aspects related to Services e.g., number of Clients.
- KRI: Key Risk Indicator. A metric used to reflect Risk (probability of an adverse outcome, reflected as monetary number) or the actual realisation of Risk i.e., the Risk has materialised. This metric can have many different categories, due to the broad range of possible Risks, see also [### Risk] earlier.
- KEI, Key Efficiency Indicator. A less used metric to reflect how well a Venture uses it's Resources versus the Revenues it generates at the Cost it incurs under the constraint of Funding. On many cases KPI will be used to reflect *any* metric related to efficiency. 
- KCI: Key Conduct Indicatorsindicate how well Staff perform with regards to the Values. 
- Other: in reality many metrics are possible to measure directly or indirectly any aspect of the Profile Tree.
  
A Benchmark also includes the expected *type of metric* e.g., binary (done, vs not done), quantitative (100 EUR, 1000 lines of code,...) or qualitative ("glossy", "pleasing to the eye", "increased sales") with a preference for quantitative metrics.
  
Although Benchmarks are mentioned as a separate deliverable in Planning, they are often established as a result of defining Objectives, Sub-Goals and Goals. The "What" aspect of an Objective mentioned above, if well defined, often automatically establishes the Benchmark.
  
At this stage it is worthwhile mentioning a potential conflict of interest in the establishment of Benchmarks and the people establishing them. If a Manager establishes an Objectives and then defines a 'weak' or 'easy' Benchmark such that achieving the Benchmark becomes relatively easy, he can be said to lower the standards of the Venture, see also [### Agency Problem]. It is therefore often desirable that an independent or higher level Management reviews and validates the Benchmarks i.e. typically a Board of Directors in the case of a Corporation. Independent establishing or vetting of Benchmarks is part of Managerial Oversight, see also Controlling. 
  
### Strategic Plan
Strategic Plans include Purpose, Vision, Mission, SWOT and Goals and possibly Sub-Goals. It has a long time frame (3 years or more) and is descriptive, but may include some long term Benchmarks. The Strategic Plan is defined by senior management.
  
### Tactical Plan 
A Tactical Plan aims at showing a high-level timeline for Goals and Objectives over a shorter period than the Strategic Plan (often 1-3 years). They are more precise than a Strategic Plan and show *what* will be achieved *when*. The Tactical Plan can cover all four Management Functions, but is mostly focused on Planning and Controlling. Depending on the manner in which Management wants to focus on specific themes within the Tactical Plan, the use of Sub-Goals may be used extensively. Tactical Plans often include Benchmarks to be able to measure and report on realisation of the plan.
  
### Operational Plan
An Operational Plan a.k.a. Operating Model describes *how* the Tactical Plan,.or in absence of it, the Strategic Plan, is achieved. More specifically, it explains *how* and *when* Assets and Suppliers are used by Staff to achieve both Run and Change Goals through the realisation of specific Objectives, ultimately yielding Revenue at Cost and Risk.
An Operational Plan contains often *all* aspects of the Profile Tree from Environment at the top, all the way down to the Business Functions and all the deliverables for each Profile Tree Item. As the focus is on the aspects of Operations, items like Mission, Vision, Values are often omitted but can, if desired, be included. Benchmarks may or may not be integrated in this plan.   
The level of detail of an Operating Model can be elaborate, for example it can contain details of how Staff communicate, how they are organised in terms of seats, how requests are managed, how infrastructure is implemented, how that infra is supported, how Staff is trained, etc. The level of detail can also vary by Activity. 
As a result of being all encompassing, the Operational Plan cannot be defined before Organising, Leading and Controlling, but instead is defined iteratively throughout the Management Cycle. The Operational Plan includes resilience which is the Venture's ability to withstand abrupt or dramatic changes in its Environment yet still function. As such, the Operational Plan is truly a blueprint of Operations of the entire Venture. The Operational Plan feeds into the SWOT as the most detailed level of the Venture's internal workings. 
  
### Intel
Intel or intelligence is the collection of information of military, political, economical, financial, scientific, technological of generally operational or strategic value. Within Planning it is composed of two types: Venture Intel and Market Intel i.e., Intel from within and from outside the Venture.
  
#### Venture Intel
Venture Intel represents any form of Intel generated within the Venture. This goes across all internal aspects of the Profile Tree i.e., everything except for the Environment. It thus includes Intel from staff, Groups, Suppliers and Management and of course the Business Functions.
  
#### Market Intel 
Market Intelligence or Market Intel is external data generated outside the Venture. This data can be used for three purposes:
1. Comparison of Venture versus Competitors in terms of all aspects of Operations and Services.
2. Insight in the position within the market the Venture operates in.
3. Obtaining insight in where the Environment is going as a whole and which may force, the Venture to accommodate its plan, or it may create an opportunity for the Venture to seize.
  
Market Intel is a key contributor to the Strategy of the Venture. It feeds directly into SWOT, and more holistically, it gives a continuous feedback loop w/r to Goals and Objectives as well as input to the Strategy of the Venture. Market Intel may lead to renewed Vision, Mission, Goals and/or Objectives (mostly Projects) to steer the Venture according to the intel gathered and processed. 
There are different sources for Market Intel: newspapers, ex-colleagues, journals, academic research, consulting companies, head-hunters, magazines, websites, etc.
Critically, Market Intel also includes any sudden change in the environment that forces the Venture to react directly, and in a non-planned manner e.g. an incident at a competitor that puts a lot of negative news on the entire sector both the Venture and competitor operate in. 
________________________________________
## Organising
Organising involves Processes to establish *how to do it*. It is forward looking in its approach.
  
This Management Function defines how Staff, Assets and Suppliers are organised to deliver the Strategy defined in Planning, and ultimately the Services. The result is an Organisation in which Staff know what to do and how, using Assets and Suppliers.
  
Key deliverables of Organising are:
- Activities (K)
- Groups (K)
- Roles & Responsibilities
  
### Activities
An Activity is essentially a container of Objectives that all work towards delivering one or more Services that are similar and/or related. Often this means that an Activity is framed by one or more Activity specific prd Sub-Goals representing those Services. Activities can roll up into other Activities, called regrouping or grouping of Activities. Grouping of Activities also includes the assessment of whether certain Activities should be outsourced outside of, or internally within, the Venture through Suppliers, see [## Suppliers]. Activities are linked to Groups, see below. The Profile Framework can be applied to an Activity in which case the Activity can be considered the Venture, and as a result, the Activity will have its own RPT. 
  
There are as many Activities required to fulfill the Operations. Each such Activity can have many aspects: 
- Overview: description which can include aspects like history. This may contain details as to how the Activity earns Revenue and manages Risk and Cost.
- Output: the Services being delivered (internal to other Activities or external to Clients). 
- Clients: the receiver of the Services: other Groups within the Venture or Clients. 
- Group: the Group that performs the Activity. 
- Assets: the Assets necessary to perform the Activity.
- Supplier: Suppliers providing input to the Activity.
  
Sometimes an Activity is transversal, i.e., it provides an output relevant to many other Activities. 
  
Depending on the Sector a Venture operates in, certain Activities are expected. For example in the banking sector the so called three lines of defense organisation is expected by regulators.
  
### Groups
Once relevant Activities have been identified, Staff performing the same Activity can be identified and grouped. Note the use of *relevant*: It is possible to break work down in many different Activities but it has to be relevant to the Planning. 
The *Grouping of Staff* working for the purpose of a specific Activity results in Groups and different names exists for them: teams, department, etc.  
Groups can roll up into other Groups which is called regrouping e.g., several Teams can be part of a Division etc. The total structure of all Groups is called the Organisation of the Venture and the relation between them is reflected in an *Organisation Chart* or *Org Chart*. Groups permeate all Management Functions and as such are an important deliverable. 
  
For each Group the following aspects can be relevant: 
- Overview: description which can include aspects like history.
- Parent: Name of the Group this Group is part of.
- Activity: the Activity or Activities performed by the Group. 
- Manager: the name of the Manager for the Group. This person is ultimately accountable for the performance of the Activity associated to the Group.
  
In most cases an Activity equals the Group associated to it. In other words, the Activity is determined by the existence of a Group of Staff performing Processes, and vice versa the Group of Staff performing those Processes reflects the Activity. As such, above properties of a Group can be omitted and one can refer to the Activity. The details for Activity and Group can thus effectively be merged. Groups form the link between Activities and Staff. Therefore, the regular review of Groups implies regular review of Staff within the Group.
  
### Roles and Responsibilities
Once Activities have been identified and Groups have been defined, Staff need to be made aware of what is expected of them within the Group. This is defined through Roles & Responsibilities which formalises the Role of the Staff within a Group and the Responsibilities assigned to that Role through *delegating* or *delegation*.
 
Deliverables for Roles & Responsibilities are:
- Delegating
- Role
- Responsibilities
- Job Description 
- Other Roles
  
#### Delegating
Delegating is a key concept (strictly speaking it is a Framework) in the design of a Venture and is defined as:
1. The act by which a *Delegator* (mostly the Manager)
2. gives *Responsibility* for completion of a Process to 
3. a suitable *Delegatee* (Staff), including 
4. the associated *Authority* that goes with said Responsibility 
5. which bestows upon the Delegatee *Accountability* to the Delegator for the Result of said Process, yet
6. without the Delegator losing the original *Accountability* which
7. requires *Oversight* from the Delegator over the Delegatee
NB: the singular *Process* above can be read as an Objective, an Activity or the entire Venture.
  
The Responsibility to perform a Process requires Authority which is the power or right to give orders and expect them to be obeyed (exact obedience), commit Resources (Staff, Assets, Suppliers), and make decisions. Clearly defined Authority is key in the ability to achieve the Result expected from the Responsibility of performing a Process. This goes two ways: 
1. The Delegatee knows which Authority was delegated; 
2. Staff, Groups and Suppliers subject to the Authority effectively know the Delegatee has obtained that Authority.
   
Once Responsibility has been Delegated, the Delegatee is automatically bestowed with the Accountability to *discharge the Responsibility* i.e., for the delivery of the Result of the Process (an often used term in regulatory guidelines). Accountability means one is liable to report to someone (Manager, CEO, Board of Directors, Shareholder, etc.) on the Result of a Process and face consequences if it is not achieved. Note that one can delegate Responsibility and Authority, but one *cannot* delegate Accountability! In other words, a Delegator *can* delegate Responsibility (and the Authority that goes with it), from which automatically flows the fact that the Delegatee owes Accountability to the Delegator. However, a Delegator *cannot* delegate that Accountability on a standalone basis i.e., cannot make a Delegatee accountable for a Process for which the Delegator has *not* delegated Responsibility nor Authority to the Delegatee.
   
As part of the overall Accountability the Delegator performs Oversight of the Delegated Process, and thus the Delegatee, to assure the expected Results have been obtained *and* in return to be able to report to the person who delegated the Process to the Delegator etc. Because Managers delegate many Processes to their reporting Staff they need perform Oversight by design of their role. As such, Oversight is an integral part of Management Function Controlling, see [## Controlling].
   
In order to delegate a Process, the Authority that goes with a Responsibility must *permit* Delegation to take place. Without such permission a Process cannot be delegated.
  
A Manager who has been delegated a Responsibility and Authority can delegate to someone else, provided that the Authority permits it. This is called *sub-delegation*.
  
A Manager can choose not to delegate i.e., to *retain* Responsibility and also Authority. A Manager can also claim responsibility back, a.k.a. to *revoke* Responsibility and Authority.
   
It is technically possible to delegate Responsibility without also delegating Authority, resulting in *Accountability without Authority*. This is not desirable, but it happens. It essentially means that the Delegatee will depend on the Delegator to get access to Resources, and to use the Delegator to exact obedience (this is where the concept of Sponsorship comes in in Project Management).
  
*Escalation* is the process of moving up the delegation tree to a level of Authority that is able to make a decision, commit resources or otherwise enforce obedience, because the person escalating does not have the Authority to do that him/herself.  

Last but not least, often Managers do not explicitly delegate Responsibilities to Staff within the Group they are the Manager for: Responsibilities are often delegated by design of the Activity organisation within the Venture. Although this is not a restriction, it does mean that Managers may not always be aware of Responsibilities being fulfilled (or not!) within the Activity they are being held Accountable for.
  
In summary, when delegating Responsibility and Authority for a Process the Delegator remains accountable for the Result to whomever the Delegator is accountable to (Manager, CEO, Board of Directors, Shareholders,...), whereas, at the same time, the Delegatee becomes responsible for assuring the Process delivers the expected Result using the Authority granted and in doing so automatically becomes Accountable to the Delegator with regards to said Result.
    
The above explains the fundamental concepts of delegating. There exist some subtleties. One is that Responsibility (and Authority) can be bestowed upon a Group instead of an individual Staff. This then means, in theory at least, that the Group is accountable. This Accountability sits in reality with the Manager of the Group, not the entire Group. 
  
#### Roles
The Role of a Staff within a Group is indicative of two key aspects from the concept of Delegating discussed above: Responsibility and Authority. The Role is most often formalised with a Job Title and/or a Corporate Title. A Job Title is a short label indicating what type of Processes (or Objectives or entire Activities) the Role is responsible for and potentially what type of Authority goes with that. The Corporate Title implies both a level of seniority in that Role as well as Authority that comes with it e.g., Associate, Vice President, Senior Vice President, Director, Managing Director, etc.  
A Role helps convey an overall idea of the level of Responsibility delegated to the Staff for a specifically or broadly defined functional scope. In addition, it helps defining what type of Responsibilities can be delegated to Staff holding that Role. This is particularly useful for Managers. It is possible to have more than one Role within a Group or across Groups! A well defined Role contains both Job Title and Corporate Title, and if the Role is well defined it also explains in just a few words the Responsibilities from a high level. 
  
#### Responsibilities
Where the Role is high level and indicative, the actual Responsibilities detail what it is that Role is really responsible for. It should also clarify the Authority the Role has to exact obedience i.e., whom should execute instructions given by the Role, and for what type of Processes. Clearly defined Responsibilities are important for two reasons: a) the obvious one of making sure what it is a Staff is expected to do, and b) less obviously, clarifies also what the Staff is *not* supposed to do. For a Manager clearly defined Responsibilities enable to assign work, by delegating to the best suited Staff or Group.
  
#### Job Description
The Job Description or JD is a document that formalises the Roles and  Responsibilities in the context of the Venture. If often gives a high-level description of the Venture in which the Activity operates and a more detailed description of the Activity in which the Role as well any expected interactions with peers in the Group and/or other Groups. In addition, a JD also details required Skills, Knowledge and Experience.
  
#### Other Roles
It is possible that various positions are held either within or outside the Venture that do not directly contribute to the Job Description. The scope is broad but can include memberships of clubs within the Venture or, more commonly, positions held in outside organisations representing the sector the Venture is part of, or positions held within other Ventures e.g., Director on the board of a non-competing organisation. Although such roles do not directly contribute to the Venture they can contribute to the well being of Staff or allow them to get a different experience and grow their Skills which in turn may be beneficial to the Venture. 
________________________________________
## Leading 
Leading involves processes to *drive* or *motivate*  those *who do it*. It is both forward and backward looking in its approach.
  
This third Management Function entails directing, influencing, and motivating Staff to perform Operations as per the Planning and within the Organisation. It also involves the social and informal sources of influence to inspire others whilst considering concerns and issues the Staff may have. Effective Managers lead Staff mostly through motivation to progressively attain Objectives.
  
Leading is often seen as a different manner to realise Objectives than Managing which can rely heavily on the concept of Delegating. However, in the broader context suggested above, Leading and Managing go hand in hand. In effect, leadership involves a manner of *interacting* with Staff that is less based on a hierarchical position or authority (established in Organising) and more on an approach based on interpersonal skills. Leading, more than Managing, is key to drive Change in modern organisations. 
  
Change is the paradigm of Management in modern days. It is impossible for most Ventures to survive without a near continuous adaptation to a changing Environment: new and improved technology, changing demands, ever evolving constraints (social, economical, regulatory, political, fiscal). Change is a necessity for many reasons but also often viewed as a constraint or stifling force. Leaders propose and guide change throughout a Venture. By growing ideas, knowledge and individuals new Leaders will emerge within the Venture and prepare it for the future.
  
In below Key Deliverables the common theme is interaction. As such, a core Process involved in Leading is some form of communication with one or more individuals.
Note that none of the Key Deliverables for Leading are tangible nor easily measurable, unlike the deliverables for Planning, Organising and Controlling.
  
Key deliverables of Leading are:
- Safe Space
- Direction
- Collaboration
- Motivation
- Inspiration
- Learning
- Leaders
  
### Safe Space
Safe Space involves two aspects: General Safe Space and Psychological Safety. The former is the overall approach of a group of people towards subjects like inclusion, appreciation across all possible subjects of difference: gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, politics and more generally different perspectives. Psychological Safety refers to the belief that the work environment is safe for interpersonal risk taking. This refers to the experience of feeling able, and even obligated, to speak up with ideas, criticism, concerns or questions without risk i.e. without being scorn, seen as incompetent, ignorant, disruptive, betraying trust of the team etc. Psychological Safety is present when colleagues trust and respect each other and feel able, even obligated, to be candid. It is the responsibility of a Manager to assure a Safe Space is created such that all Staff are aware and can, and will, use it as intended.
  
### Direction
Directing is the Process of guiding, inspiring, overseeing and/or instructing Staff towards accomplishment of the Venture's Goals and more specifically Objectives. It is  the responsibility of a Manager to assure Direction is shared with all Stakeholders: Staff, Groups of Staff, Suppliers, senior Managers and Shareholders. 
  
### Collaboration
Collaboration is the Process of two or more people working together to achieve an Objective. People can be Staff but also Suppliers. Collaboration, a.k.a. Teamwork is a catalyst for knowledge sharing and creation. This in turn positively affects Motivation. 
It is the responsibility of the Manager to assure Collaboration is facilitated such that all Staff use it as an integral part of Operations.
  
### Motivation
Motivation is the Process of stimulating Staff to act in a *specific manner* to achieve Objectives. Motivation is a key driver for the success of a Venture. Motivated Staff are more likely to:
- Have a higher propensity to contribute to Safe Space
- To drive Collaboration, and thus 
- To to drive Innovation
- To take responsibility and become the Leaders of tomorrow
- To stay with the Venture for longer
  
It is the responsibility of the Manager to assure Motivation of Staff is achieved throughout the lifetime of the Venture.
  
### Inspiration
Unlike Motivation, inspiration is the Process of influencing Staff emotionally and mentally to be *creative*. As such, Inspiration is a key deliverable to yield Change. In fact, rather than asking for a specific Change through Motivation, Manager's can generate Change, without asking, by Inspiring.
It is the responsibility of the Manager to assure Staff is inspired throughout the lifetime of the Venture.
  
### Learning
Any Venture will undergo Change and in order to accommodate that the entire Venture often needs to learn new aspects of one or more items of the Profile Tree. Often this relates to Technology, which grows at a fast pace, but it also includes changes in Management theory, including Leading. 
  
### Managers 
A key deliverable for Managers, is to help groom the Managers of tomorrow. Managers need to know how to lead, and they also need to prepare the new Managers for the future. This is done through identification of potential Managers and grooming them.
________________________________________
## Controlling
Controlling involves Processes to establish *how well it was done*. It is backward looking in its approach.
  
This fourth Management Function continuously measures output of Operations versus some form of reference, which is in most cases the Benchmark determined in Planning, and adjusts where necessary through the other Management Functions: Planning, Organising and Leading. 
  
In other words, for Goals and Objectives defined in Planning, the Management Function Controlling will check whether the targeted results were achieved. This means that even if a Goal is itself related to performing some form of Checks with regards to production Processes e.g. quality control, it is Controlling that verifies whether those Checks achieved what they were set out to do!
  
Controlling is performed through Controls, which involve 7 steps: 
1. Establish the *Purpose*;
2. Establish *Baseline* or Benchmark (mostly done in Planning); 
3. Get *Measurement* of the output of Goals/Sub-Goals/Objectives;
4. Perform a *Comparison* of Measurement vs Baseline;
5. Perform an *Analysis* of differences from the Comparison and, if relevant;
6. Define some form of *Remediation*;
7. Keep a *Written Trail* of 1-6, use it to *Report* and track Remediation.

The Control's Purpose, is fundamental: Ii sets out what a Control aims to achieve and why that is relevant. Particularly for Staff (or other Stakeholders) who are not privy to all details of Operations a Purpose helps setting the stage for understanding steps 2 to 6 and, more generally, facilitates the performance of Controls without needing to acquire all background knowledge. This is particularly important for Checks, see below. 
  
The Benchmark establishes *expected* Results from the Objectives. Most often, the Benchmark is established in Planning at the same time as the Objectives.
   
Depending on the Objective, Measurement requires a clearly defined Process describing how to measure the outcome of Objectives i.e., how to collect Data, how to create Information from the data to perform the actual Measurement,  etc. 
  
The Comparison of the Measurement versus the Benchmark can be expressed as count, percentage etc. and this can be done in tables, graphs or any format that makes the Comparison easy to interpret.
  
The Analysis consists of reviewing the Comparison and drawing conclusions as to how well the Objective was achieved. Depending on the type of Objective, Analysis as a Process can be simple, but for certain Objectives filtering, discarding outliers etc. may be required. Analysis should yield conclusions as to *why* there are differences between Measurement and Benchmark. The *why* should be explained as part of the Process to achieve the Objective either because of issues within the Process or because other Processes negatively (or positively) affecting the Objective's Process. 
Assuming that a measurements not in line with the benchmark is deemed a breach, than the analysis can yield four fundamental outcomes, out of which only the first two are desired measurements (from a statistical standpoint seen). 
1. True Positive: the breach has been correctly identified
2. True Negative: the lack of  breach has been correctly identified
3. False Positive: a breach has been incorrectly identified i.e., it is not a breach
4. False Negative: a lack of breach has been incorrectly identified i.e., a breach should have been found
  
Remediation consists of defining actions from the conclusions from Analysis, including improvement of the Control process itself (to solve False Positives and False Negatives). These actions need integration in Planning, Organising and/or Leading. 
  
Key deliverables of Controlling are:
- Journal
- Supervision 
- Reports
- Monitoring

### Journal
A Journal reflects the result of Journaling which is the Process of ongoing recording of relevant topics in a Journal as Journal entries, which is similar to a ship's log book. For the purpose of Management this  includes *all* topics that occur throughout Management i.e. Journaling is *not* limited to Controlling. Well established Journaling aids in *all* Management Functions. Journaling can be time intense, depending on how much of it the Manager does versus how much the Manager has it done for him, or her, by someone. Another factor is the format of Journaling; using pen and paper, spreadsheets, databases, etc.   
  
### Supervision 
The various steps of Controlling, described above, are fundamentally captured in Supervision. Supervision can be applied to every part of the Venture. The manner in which Managers decide to assure Supervision is done through a Supervision Framework. The Supervision Framework frames which *Supervision Processes* or Controls are applied to which *Supervision Scope*. There are four Control types: *Check*, *Review*, *Attend* and *Audit*. All except Attend are both a noun and a verb. Attend is a verb, the noun being Attendance.  
  
#### Check 
A Check consists of the full Control cycle described above i.e., understanding the purpose of the Control to be performed, verify the result of a Process against a predetermined threshold and remediate if there is a deviation. This has a strong focus on *avoiding Risk* or *assure Service quality*. Checks can be performed continuously or periodically. Continuous checks tend to be embedded within an Asset or Routine. Periodic Checks are performed with a predefined recurrence, and can also verify the *efficiency* of continuous Checks. In most businesses, when the word Control is used, it often means Check in terms of this Management Framework.
  
#### Review
A Review is a verification of the Result of a Process against a Manager's (or other relevant Staff's) opinion based on experience and knowledge and potentially some benchmark. Reviews can be less formalised than Checks. A Review is an often used method to verify progress (Performance) and/or zones of risk within Operations and/or Management and/or Clients in combination or not with the Environment (Market Intel). A Review may also act as a validation as part of a mandatory step in a broader Process. Note that the Process for Review may differ on a case by case basis. Review, is mostly performed periodically. Unlike Checks, Reviews rely on a more holistic knowledge of the Processes being reviewed as well as the Activities those Processes are part of. When doing a Review, the second step, Establish Baseline, is replaced by that holistic knowledge. 
  
#### Attend 
To Attend is similar to Review except that the Manager's opinion is replaced by a attending a (often) recurring meeting. In such a meeting the single opinion is replaced by the opinion of relevant people in the meeting. Such meetings are most often referred to as a *Committee* but other names are possible. Attendance includes the preparation of a Committee. Certain committees e.g. Board of Directors are highly formalised and scrutinised. 
  
#### Audit
An Audit consists of an independent verification of part or whole of the Profile i.e., not just Results of Processes but also the Processes themselves. Audits are done by a Group not directly related to either Operations or Management. Such Group is often a permanent establishment within a Venture in which case it is called, Audit Department or Internal Audit (IA). It is, however, possible that the performer of the audit is external to the Venture i.e., an external auditor.   
An Audit uses a broad range of Processes to obtain results that provide sufficient insight. Audits verify Processes and/or Results of such Processes and work against a broad range of Benchmarks defined at the start of the audit e.g., revenue targets, regulatory obligations, and/or Routine execution time etc. Unlike the previous Monitoring types, Audits are mostly ad-hoc and can be considered a Project.
  
Supervision Processes can result in a need for improvements which are addressed through Projects. Supervision Processes are applied to the *Supervision Scope* which refers to what it is the Managers want to supervise. In general. the Supervision Scope is the entire Venture, specifically Operations, against the backdrop of the constraints imposed by the Environment. However, depending on the manner in which a Venture is run, Managers may choose to use a different categorisation of the scope with the ultimate objective to still cover Supervision of the Operations. The following are the most common Supervision Scopes, but others may be possible, depending on the Venture.

#### Activity Based Scope
In the Activity Based Scope the Supervision Processes are applied on Activities. This means that if a Venture has many Activities, there is a chance that similar topics e.g. Finance, or HR are recurring often across the Activities, which may not be an efficient use of Resources. On the other hand, it has the Advantage that Activities are well understood. 

#### Business Function Based Scope 
In the Business Function Scope the Supervision Processes are applied to the Business Functions, which each cover a specific aspect of the Venture but across all Activities. 
This type of scope, avoids the problem mentioned above for a Venture with many Activities. On the other hand, if a Venture has defined only a few specific Business Functions, some functional aspects of the Venture may not be well covered. 
  
#### Hybrid Based Scope
The Hybrid Based Scope is a combination of the Activity Based Scope and Business Function Based Scope, and allows Managers to use different manners of Supervision. 

The output of the Supervision Framework i.e., Supervision Processes or Controls applied to the Supervision Scope is used by the Manager to make decisions. Dissemination of the results from Supervision can be done through various, potentially complementary means: mails, committees, dashboards, etc. This also includes overseeing all work delegated to Staff and Groups.

#### Managerial Oversight
One aspect of Supervision is independence of Supervision. Managers define Objectives, Sub-Goals, Goals and Strategies and these include Benchmarks and by measuring what they have defined themselves they may not have a conflict of interest. One way around this is the use of Audit as a form of Control (as Audits are independent). The other measure against such conflicts of interest is independent oversight from other managers e.g., a company's Management is overseen by the board, which is overseen by the Shareholders. 
  
### Reports
A Report aims at informing someone (the Receiver) of facts, opinions or alerts (the Content) by someone (the Reporter) for a specific reason (the Purpose). The Receiver can be one or more persons and can be a Manager, Staff, Supplier, Project Team, Stakeholder, etc. The content of a Report is mostly in written form (mail, memo, but could also be through a presentation either orally and/or with a deck, or even more formally through a booklet like Financial Statements. The Reporter consists of the person(s) disclosing the Report and can be a Manager (to his/her Manager), a Staff (to his/her Manager), the board (to Shareholders) etc. The Reporter often, but not always, prepares the Content.
  
The Purpose of a Report depends on the previous aspects as follows:

#### Management Report
A Report for a Manager provided by a Staff, a Group or Business Function or a a Manager! The Purpose is for the Manager to oversee Results from the Processes that were delegated (Routines and Projects) and adjust where necessary i.e. l, the focus is performance. In addition, this report is also used to report on concerns coming from the Environment (Market Intel). The Manager may obtain multiple Reports for each of the Managerial 7.

#### Staff Report
A Report for Staff or a Group. The purpose of such Report is to inform Staff how they are performing on their Job Description. It is used by the Manager to get indirect insight into the Managerial 7 and is important for Staff to know where to adjust time, focus, resources, or to highlight bottlenecks in output.   

#### Marketing Report
This is a Report tailored to the Strengths of the Venture and can be used for Clients, or more generally any Stakeholder. 

### Monitoring
The content of Report can lead to a cycle of feedback and follow-up. Feedback comes in the form of suggestions for improvements. These suggestions are translated into actions and these need to be planned and monitored. Planning is done in the Planning cycle of Management, or within Operations if the action is to improve Run or Change. In all cases, it is important that any action determined within a Supervisory Process is closed timely.
________________________________________
## Business Functions
Business Functions are functions within a Venture that provide specialised services permitting the Venture to operate its core activities. The difference between Suppliers and Business Functions is that the latter is often deemed internal to the Venture and often, but not always, has a strong focus on services provided to Management and less to the Operations with the notable exception of Operations, which itself can be seen as a Business Functions.
  
In very small corporations Business Functions may be performed by the Manager as part of Operations, whereas in very large corporations those functions are performed by dedicated departments. Alternatively, Business Functions can be outsourced (creating a dependency on Suppliers). 

A typical example for a financial institution follows and is used throughout the sections below:
- Finance (applies to Revenues, Cost and Funding)
- Human Resources (applies to Staff)
- IT (applies to Operations)
- Risk (applies to Operations)
- Compliance (applies to Environment)
- CorpSec or Corporate Secretary, composed of:
    - Legal (applies to Environment)
    - Tax (applies to Environment)
- Procurement (applies to Suppliers)
- Others, including:
    - Marketing (applies to Clients, Services, often an Activity)

NB: Operations (a Profile Tree Item) is *also* considered a Business Function, but in the Profile it is not. The above may be re-organised differently according to the type of Venture (Manufacturing, Service, Charity) and the sub-type within (Petrochemical, Cars, etc and Bank, Utilities etc).

The following sections cover the Business Functions:
________________________________________
## Finance
Finance, or more holistically Accounting & Financing is the Business Function concerned with measuring and reporting financial items related to the Venture and to assure Funding is available to start, and continue the Venture (going concern principle).

Key deliverables of Finance are the following:
- Accounting
- Financing

### Accounting
Accounting assures the Accounting Cycle is performed. Essentially this means: 
1. Collecting and processing of financial data like Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses (Cost) and Dividends (Withdrawals) and assuring the Accounting Equation remains balanced:
  
Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity or 
Assets = Liabilities + Stock + Retained Earnings or 
Assets = Liabilities + Stock + Revenues - Expenses - Dividends
   
see also [MGT: 80.Tools # FINANCE].
  
Note that a key part of Accounting includes Processes to formalise in which manner Revenues are *recognised*, same for Expenses, Assets, Liabilities, etc. Such recognition should be formalised throughout the Venture.
  
2. Reporting of those data both economically and accounting-wise through relevant reports for internal and external use e.g. Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash flows, and any Key Performance Indicators that are relevant to the Venture.
  
### Financing
Financing a.k.a. Corporate Financing is concerned with implementing a corporate structure and funding that structure as a going concern i.e., for continuous Operations. It has the following key elements:
1. Initial Funding for Assets, Staff and Suppliers
2. Continuous funding for Operating Costs
3. Investing in the Future of the Venture (funding Projects)
4. Optimizing the above a.k.a. Capital Management 
  
As discussed in [## Liabilities] & [## Equity]Financing is achieved through:
- Long term debt  
- Short term debt including overdraft
- Purchase on credit 
- Share issuance
- Retained earnings
  
This deliverable is also referred to as Financial Planning or Budgeting. 
NB: in some text books Finance & Accounting are each considered separate Business Functions. 
________________________________________
## Human Resources
Human Resources a.k.a. HR is the Business Function concerned with attracting, training and retaining Staff with the right Skills, Knowledge and Experience within the boundaries of employment laws. In addition, HR is also the central function for disseminating the Venture's Mission and Values. Although managers often heavily involved in the various deliverables involved in HR, the Business Function HR is central to the overall functioning.
  
Key deliverables of HR are the following:
- Recruitment
- Skill Management
- Training
- Performance Management
- Remuneration Management
- Job Satisfaction Management
- Employee Relations
- Employment Law

### Recruitment
Recruitment is the Process of attracting Staff with the right Skills i.e., for a specific Job Description. 

### Skill Management
Skill Management is the function defining Skills required to be able to operate within a Group as well as measuring those Skills in prospect and existing Staff. Skills are formalised in the Job Description (see above). 

### Training
Training is the process of adding new Skills or improving existing Skills through various means. 
 
### Performance Management
Performance Management is the function defining the setting of Objectives for Staff as well as measuring how well Objectives were met. Objectives are as per the Planning and include both Routines and Projects. An important aspect of Performance Management is reviewing *how* Objectives were achieved.

### Remuneration Management
Remuneration Management details the manners in which Staff can be attracted and retained. 

### Job Satisfaction Management
Although Remuneration is an important reason for Staff to work for a Venture, this may not be the only one. Job Satisfaction Management encompasses all the other reasons for which a Staff can work for a Venture. Such reasons can include:
- Health Insurance
- Commute Time
- Daycare facilities
- Working hour flexibility
- Etc

### Employee Relations
Employee Relations refers to the relationship with Staff on a broader basis. It includes creating awareness of the Venture's Values, providing a platform for dispute resolution, etc.

### Employment Law
Ventures operate under various laws depending on the Environment in which they operate. Most countries have some form of Employment Law and the HR department's role is to assure compliance with such laws.
________________________________________
## IT
Information Technology (IT) or Information & Communication Technology (ICT) are two different but very similar topics. IT includes use of computers, networks, software and other electronic or digital devices for the management and communication of information. ICT focuses more on how digital technologies assist users in handling information. In the Management Framework IT considers both IT and ICT.   
IT is critical to most Ventures because the majority of Input in the various Processes throughout a Venture are all digital. Even if an Activity's purpose within a Venture is to make say closets from wooden plates, the details of the inventory used (Asset) are stored digitally, as are details of the Suppliers delivering it including detail of shipment etc as are details of the end-products, and to which Clients they go. Even the manufacturing Process itself can be wholly or partially automated, which means, again, IT involvement.
  
Key deliverables for IT are:
- Infra
- Applications

### Infra
IT Infrastructure or Infra is the total of hardware and software needed to run Applications. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Servers
- Routers
- Switches
- Cables
- Firewalls
- Local Storage (NAS, SAN)
- Cloud
- System Software 
   
Most of the components above have a minimal software referred to as system software. This includes operating systems and  utility software. Both have no direct use for the Services  of the Venture. The latter includes backup-software, anti-virus etc. 

### Applications
Applications are the software that aid the Venture directly or indirectly in producing the Services. There are two main types of Applications:
- Supplied Applications
- In-house Applications
   
The former includes all off-the-shelf software i.e. software that is not part of the core Services of the Venture or which are so common that they would not lead to a competitive edge. In-House applications concerns software that contributes directly to the Services and either may have a competitive edge and/or has features that cannot be found in off-the-shelf software.
________________________________________
## Risk
Risk is both a result from Operations as well as the name of the Business Function dedicated to the management of Risk. As a Business Function, Risk is concerned with the assessment of Risk resulting from the performance of Operations including Risk embedded in the Services and Products resulting from Operations as well as the Risk that the performance of Operations engender. Assessment includes analysing, measuring, comparing to benchmarks of Risk as well as defining plans to mitigate said Risk. 
________________________________________
## Compliance
Compliance is concerned with the assessment of adherence to rules and regulations imposed by the Environment as well as adherence to internal rules and regulations.
Regulations are defined by regulators and can involve all types of topics:
- Environmental (nature, pollution)
- Client protection (ombudsman, financial regulations, data protection)
Etc.

Effectively, Compliance is concerned with a specific form of Risk mentioned under [## Operations]: Regulatory Risk. 
________________________________________
## CorpSec
Corporate Secretary also referred to as Corporate Secretariat, is the Business Function concerned with two key corporate functions that apply to the Venture transversally:  Legal and Tax. 

### Legal
The Business Function called Legal is concerned with the assessment of contractual obligations the Venture engages or envisages to engage with Stakeholders (this can thus be internal as well as external) or, by virtue of law, is applicable to the Venture. This also involves anything related to the obligations that weigh upon legal entities involved in the Venture. 

Deliverables for legal are:
- Legal Opinions
- Litigation

### Tax
The Business Function Tax is concerned with the assessment of tax obligations the Venture is required to comply with as part of its role in the Environment, including arm's length principles across wholly or partially owned legal entities in different countries involved in the Venture.

Both are each concerned with a specific form of Risk mentioned above: Legal Risk and Tax Risk, and which both work on the Venture level, particularly if the Venture is a listed company.

### Legal Entities
The legal scope of CorpSec is also concerned with legal entities, which, from a Profile perspective are captured under Assets, and for which the data is owned by Legal.  
________________________________________
## Procurement
Procurement a.k.a. Supply Chain Management a.k.a. Purchase is the Business Function concerned with defining which Suppliers would be best suited to provide Assets and Services, Staff (in the form of Consultants), and attracting and retaining these Suppliers, whilst controlling the Cost and Risk related to the Suppliers.
________________________________________
## Other

### Marketing
Marketing is the Business Function concerned with intentionally stimulating demand for and purchase of goods and services. It includes defining target *Clients*, attracting them and retaining them. Defining Clients involves establishing the Services and/or Products the Clients desires/needs as well as pricing those services/products and establishing how to advertise the Venture's capabilities to deliver the Services/Products in a manner optimal for the Client. From a Management perspective the Sales activity is part of Marketing. In many cases, Sales and/or Marketing are considered Activities instead of Business Functions. 

Key deliverables of Marketing are the following:
- Product / Client
- Price / Cost
- Place / Convenience
- Promotion / Communication
