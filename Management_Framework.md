# INTRODUCTION
This note explains the *Management Framework* a.k.a. *MF*, an intertwined set of concepts and conventions for the purpose of *Managing*.
  
The MF is composed of two notes: this note, "Management Framework " a.k.a. "MF", which explains overall concepts, whereas the second note, "Management Framework - Appendix" a.k.a. "MFA", focuses on the application of those concepts.
  
This note has the following sections:
- Introduction 
- License
- Disclaimer
- Profile
- Bibliography
- Versions
  
Conventions used in this note like [# NOTES] as well as so called Markdown formatting like *italic* and **bold** are explained in the note "Management Framework - Appendix" in  section "Notes". 
  
A *section* is the same as a chapter in text books and is visualised either by starting with '#' , '##', '###', etc. reflecting an increasing granular level like 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. or a special format e.g., larger and bolder letters if the same content is displayed in a tool supporting Markdown.

# DISCLAIMER
________________________________________
## Gender
This note assumes a Manager is male. Not so much because Managers are, or should be, male. It is more to keep language concise. Instead of constantly writing his/her, him/her, he/she, only the shortest version is used: his, him and he. 
________________________________________
## Non-Managers
This note assumes that the the principles applicable to a Manager are applicable to any Staff in a Venture. However, Manager-level employees will have more opportunities to apply the concepts mentioned in this note. 
________________________________________
## Reliability of Content
The content of the Framework (both this note, as well as the note "Management Framework - Appendix)" is borne from two aspects: experience and research. Not all aspects discussed have had the merit of a well rounded experience or application of the theory. Which aspect of the Management Framework has or has not had that exposure is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, given that Management is both a topic of academic research, but also, if not more, an experience based topic, it is quite possible certain concepts written in these notes, are part of academic research, without that academic research having been cited, simply because it was not read by the author. If such research is available, the reader is asked to notify the author, such that the latter can review the research and integrate it in the framework if that were to be deemed relevant.

# PROFILE
This section explains the concept of a *Profile* including how it is used in Management. It first gives an overview of what a Profile is and then for each of the aspects of the Profile detailed explanations are given. Words with capitalised first letters are deemed *core* to the Profile and the first occurrence in the text is *italicised*.
  
The Profile is a foundational *conceptual* structure that can be used by Managers at all levels. It is based on academic resources, industry standards, as well as own experience. Resources are cited where relevant.  
________________________________________
## Profile Overview
The *Management Tree*, *Management Profile* or *Profile*, is the building block of the Management Framework. It explains the overall structure a Manager is accountable for in a holistic manner, whilst leaving room to adapt to specific circumstances e.g., different business structures, different sectors, etc.
  
The Profile is designed around the concept of a *Venture*. A Venture is a Company, Organisation, Corporation or Enterprise. The Management Framework uses the term Venture to avoid differences, subtle or not, on structures that are not relevant to the concepts themselves.
________________________________________
## Profile Tree
The Profile expresses a Venture through a *Profile Tree*, composed of interrelated *Profile Tree Items* as follows:
    
- Venture
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

This visual representation is summarised below.  
________________________________________
## Profile Tree Executive Summary
The main objective of a *Venture* (Company, Organisation, Corporation or Enterprise) is to generate more *Revenue*, or *Income* from the sales of  *Services* and/or *Goods* to *Clients*, than the *Cost* to yield those Services through *Operations*. Operations consists of all *Processes* (*Steps* applied to *Inputs* to achieve *Output*) contributing directly or indirectly to the continuous sales and delivery of Services a.k.a. *Run*, as well as continuous improvement of that Run through *Change*. Processes are performed and/or overseen by *Staff* (employees) using *Assets* and with input from *Suppliers* (internal or external). Combined, Staff, Suppliers and Assets are *Resources* which generate Costs (salaries, rent, depreciation, electricity, costs of goods sold, fees, etc.). These Costs are covered through Cash from Revenues combined with *Capital* in the form of *Liabilities* and *Equity*. Liabilities or *Debt* include long and short-term loans, bonds but also purchases on credit. Equity represents money invested into the Venture and thus implies a form of *ownership*. Operations also yield *Risk*, defined as the probability of unplanned events with adverse outcomes. The latter are either *direct* (loss of Revenue through fines, recall of Services, legal costs) or *indirect* (loss or damage of Resources) and they are immediate or in the future. Unplanned events occur because of i) failures or weaknesses in Processes and/or Resources and/or ii) because of unforeseen conditions created internally (Management, Staff, -internal- Suppliers, Assets) or externally through Suppliers, Clients and the *Environment*. Environment consists of external forces that affect Clients, Services, Operations and Management either directly or indirectly without any of them having direct influence on those forces. The majority of these forces include *Investors & Creditors*, *Politics, Laws & Regulations*, *Competitors* *Climate & Weather*, *Geography & Nature*, *Economy & Tax*, *Society & Culture*, *Science & Technology* and *Infrastructure*. In short, Risk is a form of *probabilistic* Cost, and the management of Risk incurs an *actual* Cost e.g., extra Staff, insurance, backup Assets etc.  
Revenue, Cost and Risk are the monetary *Results* of Operations as opposed to the non-monetary, intangible result *Image* which reflects the opinion of the Venture as a whole as held by any people in the Environment and within the Venture itself. Revenue minus Cost is called *Earnings* or *Profit*. Revenue and Cost also make up one of the key *Financial Statements* called *Income Statement* (a statement of Revenues and Costs over a *Financial Period*) whereas Assets³⁾, Liabilities and Equity make up the other: *Balance Sheet* (a statement at the end of that Financial Period). 
Operations are central to a Venture, and they are initiated and continuously improved by *Management* through four *Management Functions*: *Planning*, *Organising*, *Leading* and *Controlling* a.k.a. *POLC*, such that Profit is maximised, Risk minimised and the Venture's Image is maintained positive. Planning consists of strategy *formulation*, whereas Organising and Leading constitute strategy *implementation*, and Controlling consists of *verifying* the implementation. Management applies the POLC to Operations but also to *Business Functions* which are transverse topics across the Venture like *Finance*, *Human Resources*, *Information Technology*, *Compliance*, *Risk*, *Legal*, *Tax*, *Procurement*, *Communications*, and *Marketing*. Management relies on *Tools* in the form of *Research*, *Definitions*, *Frameworks*, *Procedures* and *Software* to achieve its targets. Lastly, Management is in practice a *Management Cycle* in which the theoretic concepts of POLC, Business Functions and Tools blend into a practical continuous output.  
  
The next four paragraphs provide more details on the POLC, which, being functions, are foundational to Management.
  
Planning establishes *what, where, when, why and how* is to be done within Operations by defining why the Venture exists (*Context*, *Purpose*, *Vision* and *Mission*), within which boundaries it expects to function (*Values* and *Bylaws*) and how it assesses the Environment versus its own performance (*SWOT* and *Intel*). Planning also defines *Goals* and *Objectives*. Run Goals focus on continuously delivering Services to Clients, with four Run Goals being essential: a) Manage Venture, b) Perform production (Value Chain), c) Perform oversight (Control Chain) and d) Perform overhead (anything not contributing to a-c but required nevertheless). Change Goals *improve* Run Goals to a) Grow Revenue, b) Protect existing Revenue at risk of being lost, c) Secure Run to reduce Risk, and d) Optimise Run to reduce Cost and/or increase Revenue. Both Run and Change Goals can have Sub-Goals that tie into *Activities* (see below). An *Objective* is a *precise*, *time-based* Process or series of Processes, the output of which supports the completion of a (Sub-) Goal and thus the delivery of a Service or improvement thereof. Objectives consume Assets and Suppliers and are performed or overseen by Staff. Objectives are either *Routines* (link to Run Goals) or *Projects* (link to Change Goals). Planning also establishes various types of metrics or *Benchmarks* like KPI, KRI which are used in Controlling. Lastly, the result of Planning is a Plan which can be a *Strategic Plan*, *Tactical Plan* and/or *Operational Plan* a.k.a. *Operating Model* (a blueprint of the Profile Tree).  
  
Organising establishes *how to do* what was Planned and *who should do it* by defining *Activities* which regroup related Sub-Goals and/or Objectives and defines how Staff are organised in *Groups* linked to those Activities. The sum of Groups (and thus Activities) is the Venture's Organisation reflected in an *Organisational Chart*. Organising establishes *Roles & Responsibilities* which includes the concept of *Delegation* of *Responsibility* and *Authority* across Activities whilst creating *Accountability* throughout the Venture. Roles & Responsibilities are formalised in a Job Description. *Casting* assures specific individuals are found for each Job Description as well as the right Suppliers. Lastly, *Funding* assures Capital required for Operations is maintained.
  
Leading involves *driving* those *who perform Operations* by directing, influencing, inspiring, and motivating individual Staff,  Groups and Suppliers to achieve Objectives. Leading consists of establishing a *Safe Space* such that *collaboration*, *motivation*, *inspiration*, and *learning* are all maximised. Leading involves *Networking* and also grooms *future Managers* and finally, Leading reflects upon one-self as Manager through *Management Improvement*. 
   
Controlling establishes *how well it was done* by verifying Results of Operations versus the Benchmarks from Planning, analysing the differences and adjusting through Planning, Organising and Leading. Controlling is done through *Supervision* via a *Supervision Framework* composed of *Supervision Processes* or *Controls* of four types: a) *Check* (verify vs Benchmark), b) *Review* (verify vs an opinion), c) *Attend* a *Committee* (verify vs a broader range of opinions) or d) *Audit* (verify vs an *independent* opinion). Controls result in *Reports* with suggestions for improvements. *Monitoring* assures tracking, and implementation of those improvements. Lastly, *Journaling* is used to keep track of work done across all four Management Functions. The principles of Controlling can be applied to Outputs, Inputs, and the Steps of individual Processes.
   
The Management Framework permeates the entire Venture and can be applied to varying extent at any *Management Level* within the Venture (Director of the Board, CEO, department head, team leader, etc.).     
  
It is worth noting that the Profile is a simplification of complex concepts that have many properties, and which are often implemented in complex Venture structures. Additionally, the proposed structure in the Profile is a *possible* way of looking at a Corporation, it is certainly not the only way. Nevertheless, the simplification helps see the trees in the forest, and helps focusing on the fundamentals of what a Venture is ultimately about.  
  
Notes:  
- Environment impacts every aspect of the Venture.  
- Services often embed Risk e.g., financial products, machinery, drugs, etc. Pro-active management of this Risk is part of Operations.  
- Assets on the Balance Sheet are a sub-set of Assets in Operations, e.g., a *procedure* is an Asset in Operations but not in the Balance Sheet.  
- If we consider Risk to 'merely' be a (probabilistic) Cost, the objective of Management is thus Profit maximisation. 
- Strictly speaking Management should not be part of the Run, which itself sits in Operations. However, it is included nevertheless because a) Management occurs at various levels, see further below, and 2) for smaller Ventures, Operations and Management are more integrated.   
   
Although the Profile Tree is focused on Profit making Ventures, the concepts apply equally to non-profit organisations like charities, religious institutions etc., the main differences are 1) the manner in which Operations are funded (membership fees, donations, government subsidies);  2) the main target is not to achieve Profit maximisation but rather the continuation of Operations i.e., to have enough funding to cover the Cost; and 3) the ownership structure is often more centralised.
________________________________________
## Alternative Views of the Profile Tree
The Profile Tree can be assessed in different manners each enforcing a better understanding of a Venture. These alternative ways are discussed below. 
  
### Profile Tree Top and Bottom
Another way to understand the Profile Tree is to break it down into two parts: *Top Profile Tree* and *Bottom Profile Tree*, indicated by the two blocks between the dashed lines in above diagram. The Top Profile Tree says: 
- What is created (Services)
- Whom receives those Services (Clients)
- Which constraints and dependencies affect the manner in which the Services are created and maintained (Environment)
  
The Bottom Profile Tree focuses on:
- How is the Top Profile Tree achieved (Operations)
- How are Operations initiated and improved (Management)

### Reduced Profile Tree
The Reduced Profile Tree or *RPT* focuses on key elements of the Bottom Profile Tree with the Operations profile tree items in the middle and the Management Functions on the left and right:
  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
Planning     ⇔  *Processes*  
                  ⇕  
Organising ⇔ *Resources* ⇔ Leading   
                  ⇕  
Organising ⇔ *Capital*  
                 ⇕   
               *Results*    ⇔  Controlling   
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -       
[Fig 2: the Reduced Profile Tree]
    
This view shows the relation between Operations and Management. As will be seen later, Controlling is not restricted to Results, it applies also to Processes and Resources. Similarly, the other Management elements do not strictly only apply to the Operations elements they are in front of. Nevertheless, the diagram again aids in understanding the relations between the different Profile Tree Items. 
   
The Profile Tree and Reduced Profile Tree provide *structure* and *insight* as to how each item plays part in a Venture and how items are interrelated. The relative importance of each item depends on the Venture.  
  
### Going Further
Words with capitalised first letters are core to the Profile. They are either a Profile Tree Item or a deliverable related to it. The [## Profile Tree Executive Summary] reflects the majority of these capitalised words which are detailed in the rest of this note starting with Tools to introduce several concepts deemed key for the understanding of the rest of the document.
________________________________________
## Tools
Management Tools or in short Tools aid Managers in the performance of Management. Although Tools is a deliverable within Management, covered later in this note, it appears here because of how the concept is defined and what it is composed of. It is worth noting that "tools" are of course used everywhere including in Operations, to aid in the performance of Run and Change e.g., a wrench, software, printer, etc. However, those tools are deemed Assets. In other words in the Management Framework, Tools means Management Tools and it refers to any Tool used as part of Management. If such tools can also aid elsewhere in the Profile Tree, even better. 
  
The following types exist: 
- Research
- Definition
- Framework
- Procedure 
- Software 
  
### Research
Research is the result of reading, watching, or listening to different sources of information to enhance the manner in which a Manager performs his role. Sources include academic literature, books, newspapers, articles, documentaries, blogs, podcasts, etc. The vast majority of research is nowadays available online. Research also includes Networks built by a manager which includes recurring or ad hoc interactions with other Managers, alumni, peers, industry groups and individuals or groups that have exposure to Management.
  
### Definition
A Definition helps shaping and scoping specific topics such that they are understood in the same way across Management or the entire Venture. Definitions also include conventions used. This note contains many such Definitions. 
  
### Framework
A Framework is a conceptual structure intended to support a specific aspect of one or more Management Functions' Processes. It acts as a guideline that helps Managing a topic without being specific about Processes involved in it. Acting more as guidelines Frameworks are not absolute truths nor do they guarantee specific, reproducible outcomes. Templates are part of Frameworks. This note contains many Frameworks.
  
### Procedure
A Procedure is an established or formalised manner of performing a Process. It is a well documented explanation of what to do, how, where, when, and by whom. Procedures are used to define, configure and perform Processes in an optimal manner. Unlike Frameworks, a Procedure yield precise and reproducible Results, and it involves manual work. 
  
### Software
A Software is downloaded for free, purchased or developed. It achieves a specific outcome either by configuration or automating a manual Process, and/or by simplifying a Process even if it remains partially manual.  
  
The Profile is itself a Framework whereas the Profile Tree Items are  Definitions. 
  
Some key Tools used in the rest of the Management Framework are discussed below:

### Topic Definition
The word Topic is relatively common to not really warrant a definition. However, the Management Framework formalises it nevertheless. 
  
A Topic is an idea, subject or theme that is dealt with in written or spoken discourse.  
  
The *Topic Scope* is virtually unlimited. Even within the context of Management Framework there are many Topics in general, and they can multiply fast by refining the context around a Topic. For example, Income can be a Topic, but the Income of a specific Activity is another, even if related Topic. Effectively everything single item in the Management Framework is a Topic. 
  
A Topic can fall within a *Topic Category*. For example, Income can be tagged to Finance. However, many Topics are related to more than one Category. For example, Income can also be tagged to Income Statement or Corporate Tax. As such, it is not easy to isolate a Topic. 
    
### 6W Framework
The 6W Framework aids in framing *any* topic by enforcing answers to 6 fundamental questions: *What*, *Where*, *When*, *Who*, *Why* and *How* a.k.a. *Which* (hence 6W). The following are examples for each:
- What: name, description, overview, ...
- Where: geographical location in building, asset, ...
- When: history of topic, future events, recurrence, ...
- Who: person/people doing or receiving something, skills, ...
- Why: purpose of topic, relevance to other topics, ...
- Which: a.k.a. How, manner in which topic is achieved, ...
  
### Process Definition
It can be argued that a Process does not really require a definition, given its commonness. However, it is preferable to have a formal definition that can be used systematically across the Profile. The reason for this is that a Process is so fundamental to what happens within a Venture that assuming everybody interprets it the same way, may be wrong and thus yield sub-par results when using the Management Framework.   
  
A Process is one or more *triggered* or *continuous* *Steps* applied to one, or more forms of *Input* to achieve one, or more forms of desired *Output*:
    
    Input(s)  ⇒  Step(s)  ⇒  Output(s)
   
A well designed Process is completely defined by the 6W Framework. In other words, What Output is to be delivered, Where and When, *by* Whom and *for* Whom, Why is the Output relevant, and How is it achieved i.e., which Inputs are used and what does each Step do with the Input. Note that "Where" can be a geographic location, but can also refer to an Asset in which a Process is embedded.
  
Output is determined by what is the *desired* Result. Output thus drives the design of the Steps to be applied to the Input. The actual Output may differ of course from what was intended i.e., as a consequence of a faulty Process or an undesirable but unavoidable by-product. Output can be anything from a decision to a physical object. 
  
Input can be any of the following: Assets, Services from Suppliers and Outputs from other Processes or from the Process itself (internal loop-back). Therefore, they have constraints: time, energy, manpower, cost, etc. 
  
Steps represent the *logic* of the Process: they determine how Input is transformed into a specific Output. They may be manual or automatic (the latter case is triggered manually or by another Process).  
  
It is possible, and even likely, that several Processes, and thus Outputs, need to be combined to obtain a final Output. Such combined Processes have different names e.g., Activities, Macro-Processes, Process Group, etc.
  
Processes can have several properties or attributes.
  
*Process Status* is an indication of whether a Process is active, suspended, failing, etc. Assigning a status helps in dealing with Processes in a structured manner. Depending on the type of Process or the purpose of the Process, different statuses can exist. 
  
*Process Maintenance* is the notion of manually or automatically applying specific Processes to other (target) Processes to assure such target Process keeps yielding the expected Result over time. As these are extra Processes purely built to keep the target Process operational it adds to the overall Cost of the target Process.
   
*Process Complexity* is determined by the multitude and complexity of the Steps and/or Inputs. Process Complexity has an impact on Process Maintenance. There is no generally accepted standard in terms of how to rate Process complexity. 
  
A *Process Owner* is the Group or Staff expected to yield an Output, making a Process Owner the Output Owner. However, they may not own the Input which may be produced by Processes outside of the Process Owner remit, i.e., the owner faces a *dependency* on another Process and thus Process Owners. 
  
*Process Cost* is the cost of a Process. Often this Cost is hard to price, and may not be relevant on a per Process basis. Nevertheless, each Process incurs cost. Process Cost can be related to time spent by Staff on a Process.
  
A Process has Risk associated to it, by definition, see above. The assessment of that Risk for a given Process is key in Risk Management. Sometimes specific Processes are designed to verify another Process has yielded a specific Output as per expectations. Such a Process is referred to as a Control or a Check. By definition, even Controls have Risk embedded in them.
    
Optimising Processes such that they yield highest Revenue at lowest Cost and with as little as Risk possible, is key in Management.
    
Any Process or change in Process should directly or indirectly:
- Maintain or Increase Revenue and/or  
- Maintain or Reduce Risk and/or  
- Maintain or Reduce Cost and/or  
- Report to Stakeholders or improve an aspect to one or more Stakeholders not part of the above 
    
If a Process or change in Process does not achieve the above directly or indirectly then it is likely it should not be performed at all. The assessment is easy for Processes that directly have an influence as per above. It is more difficult to establish for Processes that contribute indirectly i.e., the path from the Process to the final desired Output is long and involved. For example, more motivated Staff could lead to increased Revenue, but that link is difficult to establish. The truth is that, particularly in large organisations, the majority of Processes are indirect. This is typically reviewed by Managers either directly or through audits, or through a specific Framework called Business Process Analysis or Business Process Engineering.

### Work Definition
The term Work is a catch-all generic term for any Processes expected to be, or actually being performed by a Staff or Supplier as in "the Work performed by John Doe". 

### Stakeholder Definition
Stakeholders are people affected by the Venture. They are either internal (Staff, Manager) or external (Environment, Clients, Suppliers, and including people impacted without being any of the previous for example citizens living in a zone of Operations of a Venture). The consideration of their interests falls within a Manager's remit.
________________________________________
## Venture 
Strictly speaking, a Company, Enterprise or Corporation is what is happening within the two blocks between the dotted lines in Fig 1. The Services produced within dotted lines i.e., within the Venture, but then sold or offered to Clients, which sit outside of the Venture. The Services are effectively what links the Venture to the Clients. However, in the Management Framework, the Venture is larger than a Company, Enterprise or Corporation. It is the total of aspects of the Profile Tree to emphasise how all aspects of the Profile Tree are of constant importance to Management.
  
The key aspects of the Venture are the type of Venture it is, which in turn drives several aspects of Operations and Management of it. Although most concepts in the Management Framework can be applied to non-commercial Ventures as well as commercial ones, the focus here is going to be on commercial ones i.e., Companies.
    
### Ownership
A Venture is an entity that ultimately generates Revenue, Cost and Risk and engages in various forms of Debt or Liabilities. Someone is to receive the benefit of those Revenues, and has to pay for the Cost, and be answerable to repay any debt that was taken on. This person (or people) is the Owner of the Venture. The Ownership concept is key in the *Company Structure*. 
  
### Company Structure
The Company Structure or Business Structure refers to the legal implementation of a Company. Such implementation is partially driven by the type and size of the Venture, but also the country in which the Company operates. Note that the size of a company can change over time, and as a result the Company Structure can change accordingly. The constitution of a company under a country's specific set of laws is called *business formation*. As business formation is country specific it is unrealistic to give all possible definitions of legal forms of a business. However, there are general Company Structure types that are recognised, in some form, in most countries. Note that there is a difference between a company and a corporation which will become clear when reviewing the different types of companies below. 
  
- Sole proprietorship: one individual handles all Operations as well as Management of the company. The Sole Proprietor is also the Owner of the company and assumes liability of the debt of the company.
- General Partnership: this follows a similar structure as the Sole Proprietorship, but has two or more individuals called *Partners* who are the Owners and who run Operations and Management. They thus assume liability for losses and debt and any misconduct that occurs from *either* Partner.
- Limited Liability Partnership: an LLP refers to a Company where each Partner has a predetermined threshold of liability for the losses or debts of the Company. The Partners generally assume responsibility for their own actions but not the misconduct or faults of the *other* Partners.
- Limited Liability Company: an LLC refers to a Company that combines aspects of a Partnership and a Corporation (see below). It has the legal status of a Corporation but follows tax regulations of a Partnership or Sole Proprietorship.
- Corporation: a specific form of Company which as a legal entity is separate from its Owners. Corporations perform the basic functions of a company (Operations) and often operate on a larger scale. Unlike all above forms, Corporations sell shares to the *public* which can include private entities like asset managers, pension funds, as well as individuals. By selling shares to public they relinquish ownership to *Shareholders*. The Shareholders are not personally liable for debt or actions taken by the Corporation. However, any losses will be reflected in the shares held. Shareholders are only the Owner. The people making decision for and within the company are its Management, specifically the Executives i.e., the senior management or C-suite Management Level (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc) all the way down to line Management who lead Staff.
  
Above forms all assume Ventures whose main purpose is to increase Profit. There are of course other forms of Ventures with different objectives. For example religious institutions, governmental or state owned institutions and charities. Such Ventures mostly follow the concepts of the Profile Tree: they provide some form of -potentially free- Service through Operations which can be continuously improved through Management. 
  
The Management Framework covers all above forms of company, but will, as often as possible assume the scope at the level of a Corporation as form of Venture. 
      
### Agency Problem
The Agency problem occurs when people (agents) making decisions on behalf of owners (principals) have a conflict of interest i.e., the decision is favourable for the agent but not the principal. For example, a Manager (agent) may have an interest to not merge with another company as it would reduce his sphere of influence, whereas from a profit maxmimisation perspective it would be in the interest of the Shareholder (principal) to merge. The Agency problem is inherent to a structure where ownership and decision making is decoupled i.e., in Corporations. In Corporations Executives make decisions in relation to investments, financing including taking on Liabilities in the form of Debt, and the decisions can be to the betterment of themselves but at the expense of shareholders, at a cost which is referred to at the Agency Cost (Larcker, 2021). The Agency cost can be substantial to investors. To decrease the Agency Cost a system of checks and balances is put in place across the Venture known as  Corporate Governance (Larcker, 2021).
  
### Corporate Governance 
Larcker (2021) defines Corporate Governance as the collection of control mechanisms an organisation adopts to prevent or dissuade potentially self-interested Managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders and stakeholders. Said differently, and expressing it with regards to the Profile, Corporate Governance refers to the manner in which Roles & Responsibilities are distributed from Owners of the Corporation through Management all the way to the Staff performing Operations such as to avoid or minimise Agency Cost. 
    
The classic approach of Corporate Governance is as follows (Monks, 2011):
- Shareholders are the Owners of the Venture and expect sustainable growth. They elect or *vote* for a small group of people often called the *Board of Directors* to represent their interests. The more shares someone holds, the more it can direct the constitution of the Board of Directors.    
- Board of Directors (BOD): people elected by Shareholders to represent their interests by setting the strategic direction of the Venture and by monitoring Management's performance in achieving it. The BOD focuses mostly on the Executive level and thus on the Results of Operations.  
- Management: people assigned with the improvement of Operations such that they yield the Strategy within applicable constraints of incorporation. As mentioned before, this goes from Executives or C-suite level all the way down to line Management who ultimately lead Staff. 
- Staff: people who, with the help of Suppliers, and using Assets perform Operations which, if done as planned, yields the strategy set out by the BOD.
  
However, modern Corporate Governance covers a wider scope and includes Managers, Board of Directors, Investors, Auditors, Customers, Suppliers, Unions, Media, Regulators, Analysts and Creditors (Larcker, 2021). Ultimately, good Corporate Governance decreases the Agency Cost whilst the implementation Cost is less than said Agency Cost. 

### Going Concern
The going concern principle states that a Venture will meet its financial obligations (Liabilities) when they come due, and this without a need to liquidate Activities in the foreseeable futures which is generally accepted as one year. In the Management Framework a Venture is deemed to continue as a going concern.
________________________________________
## Environment
The Environment of a Venture consists of *external forces* that can, and often will, influence, partially or fully, Clients, Services, Operations or Management, either directly or indirectly and without the Venture having any form of control over that influence. Environment is important in SWOT analysis (see below) and general Risk Management. 
  
The Environment has *Environment Dimensions* as follows:
- Investors & Creditors
- Politics, Laws & Regulations
- Competitors
- Climate & Weather
- Geography & Nature
- Economy & Tax
- Society & Culture
- Science & Technology
- Infrastructure

These dimensions may not directly impact the Venture, but rather the Clients, Suppliers or Staff related to the Venture. For example income tax is not directly applicable to the Venture (profit or corporate tax is), but high income tax regimes means the cost of living is higher which may make it more difficult to attract skilled Staff from lower income tax countries.  
  
The Environmental Dimensions are primarily driven by Country(ies) and the Sector(s) the Venture operates in. A Market Sector, Economic Sector or Sector in short, defines a regrouping of similar types of Services offered to Clients. There are different types and different qualifications of Sectors. The one used in the Management Framework is the official Global Industry Classification Standard or GICS® (MSCI et al, 2023). The GICS uses 11 Sectors, which each contain 2 or more Industry Groups, which each contain 1 or more Industries, which each contain 1 or more Sub-industries. For the Management Framework the Sector-level is sufficient in general:
- Energy (oil, natural gas, but not renewables which are under Utilities)
- Materials (provide services to other manufacturers)
- Industrials (heavy equipment companies, including airline, railroad, logistics companies)
- Utilities (renewables, electricity delivery, natural gas transmission, water delivery)
- Healthcare (development of pharmaceuticals, healthcare equipment)
- Financials (anything handling money, including insurance)
- Consumer Discretionary (companies producing Services depending on financial status of Clients)
- Consumer Staples (anything Clients need regardless of financial status e.g., food, beverage tobacco, personal care)
- Information Technology (anything related to digital not part of communication Services)
- Communication Services (telecommunications like telephony, but also media and entertainment companies like TV and interactive entertainment via internet)
- Real Estate (development of, and maintenance of real estate)
  
A single Venture can operate in one or more Sectors. For example Reliance Industries offers services across many of above Sectors.
  
### Investors & Creditors
Investors represent people financing the Venture by becoming (partial) Owner of it through Equity. Creditors provide sources of Financing by extending some form of Debt to the Venture (without becoming Owner). The Business Function Finance is directly related to these dimensions.

### Politics, Laws & Regulations
Politics represents the governmental and judicial structure, and also includes military as extension of politics. Politics yield some form of Law applicable to different aspect of a Venture e.g., employment law (tax law is discussed below under Economics & Tax). Regulators establish Regulations. Regulations result from Politics but are narrower in their application i.e., they apply to specific Sectors. They thus have a direct impact on Services and/or Operations and/or an indirect impact through Clients and Suppliers if the Venture operates within such regulated Sectors. The Business Functions Compliance, Risk, and Legal are concerned with these dimensions. 
  
### Competitors
Competitors offer similar or the same Services to similar or the same Clients in the same Sector(s) the Venture operates in. They are an integral part of Economics in terms of supply and demand. Competitors offering services closest to the Venture's Services are called *Peers*. The Business Function Marketing is concerned with this dimension.
  
### Climate & Weather 
These includes aspects like temperature, rainfall, humidity, tornadoes, monsoons, drought, etc. Depending on the Business Model of the Venture, several Business Functions can be concerned with this dimension. 
  
### Geography & Nature 
Geography includes consequences of the location the Venture operates in and which are not Climate related e.g., soil, volcanoes, risk of earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. Nature refers to the natural plant and wildlife as a result of Climate, Geography and potentially under the impact of Society. Depending on the Business Model of the Venture, several Business Functions can be concerned with this dimension. 
  
### Economy & Tax
Economy refers to the supply and demand of goods and Services within a country, as well as the dependency on other countries for such supply/demand. It also includes monetary policy. Tax, although determined by Politics and Law is closely linked to Economics. Tax determines a broad range of taxes applicable to the Venture: profit tax, services tax, stamp duties, but also income tax of Staff salaries, accounting standards and also the fiscal policy maintained in a country. The Business Functions Tax is concerned with this dimension. 
  
### Society & Culture
Society refer to the total of social forces excluding Politics and Economics that make up a society. It includes aspects like art, cuisine, music, movies, sports, religion, healthcare, demographics, labour unions. Culture is defined as the set of written and unwritten rules for expected behaviour and has an effect from outside as well as within the Venture. Depending on the Business Model, several Business Functions can be concerned with this dimension. 
  
### Science & Technology
Science is the pursuit of answering questions in different fields of knowledge (business, physics, biology, chemistry etc). Technology is a practical application of the outcome of Science and is a main driver of innovation. Depending on the business model of the Venture, several Business Functions can be concerned with this dimension. 
  
### Infrastructure
Infrastructure: represents facilities available to the Venture and that support it including access to real estate, energy, telecommunication and transportation including transport of specialist materials like some form of gases or liquids. Depending on the business model of the Venture, several Business Functions can be concerned with this dimension. 
________________________________________
## Clients
Customers or Clients consist of *external* or *internal* individuals, groups, or corporations receiving the benefit of Services. Without Clients, there is no purpose for Services to be delivered. Understanding Clients's needs and constraints is thus critical to assuring Services are optimal. Obtaining this insight is often part of Marketing.
  
Obviously, the range of Clients is vast, from individuals to entire Companies and anything in between like Small and Medium Enterprises. How a Venture manages its Clients depends among others on where a Client is located within this range, but also the Sector in which the Venture offers its Services to those Clients.  
________________________________________
## Services 
Services is a single term used to describe both Goods and/or Services. Goods can be raw materials, finished Products or anything in between. Services are non-tangible output of Operations. Services could be considered a Result. The reason why it is considered on a standalone basis, is that Services is the aspect that is not 'retained' within Operations and Management, but effectively leaves the Venture once it is sold and has generated Revenue. A Service *may* return to Operations, generating Cost as part of post-sales support for example.   
Both Goods and Services are of value to Clients, and they are thus willing to do an effort to obtain them, or for which they will be appreciative in some manner, most often monetary. In certain cases Services can be composed of Services *and* Products. For example, stock exchanges deliver various Products (Stock, ETF, Options, ...) through various Services (Trading, Clearing, Settlement, Market Data, ...) or Computer Hardware companies sell Products (computers) but also offer Services (repair, help desk) to support those Products. Some Services are for the benefit of the Venture itself i.e., internal Services like Risk Management, IT Support, etc. Services are expected to be of good *quality* which means a Service should respond *simultaneously* to:
- Client expectations and
- Laws or Regulations
  
Key deliverables for Services are:
- Run
- Change
  
### Run
These are the Services Clients tend to expect either because they already receive it, or because they are an accepted norm of level of Service, or because it is a mandated Service e.g., a regulatory requirement.
  
### Change
Change Services consists of Services applied to Run Services such that the Run Services generate more Revenue, and/or protects existing Revenue and/or at lower Cost and/or at lower Risk. 
  
For each Service, there are various aspects to consider:
- Overview: description which can include aspects like history, Environment, and including details of what the Service consists of and what the benefit is for the Client/Venture.
- Internal/External: is the Service delivered internally (to another Activity that needs it as input) or externally (to a Client).
- Activity: the Activity/Activities delivering the Service.
- Competitors: companies that offer similar or exactly the same Service.
- Revenue from selling the Service
- Cost of producing the Service    
________________________________________
## Operations
Operations involves the performance of Processes through Resources (Staff, Assets and Suppliers) to deliver Results in the form of Services to ultimately yield Revenue. Resources are funded through Revenue (in Results) and through Liabilities and Equity (part of Capital). In addition to the generation of Revenue, Run and Change generate Cost and Risk, both undesired, but unavoidable.   
The so called Operating Model , designed and maintained as part of Planning,  reflects the manner in which Operations are performed. Operations are the most work intense part of the Profile as it reflects actual work done to yield Results. Operations are dynamic in that they evolve over time under the direction of Management. In academic literature Operations is sometimes deemed a Business Function.
  
Despite the conceptual simplicity of Operations, it is one of the most complex Profile Tree items. This complexity stems from the fact that depending on the Sector the Services are aimed at, the Processes involved will differ fundamentally. For example, the production of a Smartphone has completely different requirements than the production of tractors or the delivery of insurance Services. This complexity can be easily understood by studying standard academic literature on Operations Management like for example Slack, 2010. 
  
Key deliverables for Operations are the following:
- Processes
- Resources
- Funding
- Results

Given their importance, they each have a dedicated section.
________________________________________
## Processes
Processes is the name given to *all* the Processes i.e., *all* things being *done* in Operations. It does not consider whether certain Processes are done by certain Staff or whether the Processes are organised in departments, teams etc., that is part of Organising. Processes also does not consider whether the Output of one Process is directly or indirectly contributing to the Services offered to Clients.
  
The main deliverables within Processes are the following:
- Run
- Change 

### Run
The Run, or Run The Organisation a.k.a. Production or Prod, is composed of Processes done in a recurring or continuous manner and which generate Run Services. The name comes from the expression "Running a Business". Recurring can be continuously, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, two-yearly, ad-hoc (triggered), etc. Run is often broken down into two *chains*:
- The *Value Chain*: Processes directly or indirectly generating the Services that drive Revenue.
- The *Control Chain*: Processes assuring the quality of the Services delivered in the Value chain.
  
The Value Chain represents the Routines that generate Services (directly or indirectly) that are sold to Clients. This should be seen broadly. It includes everything from research and development, production of actual Goods or Services, marketing, sales, after sales. The Control Chain are those Processes that perform Services that verify the results of the Value Chain are as expected. Control should be seen broadly. For example, it could be a check of the product to make sure it features the expected qualities, on the other hand it can also include measures taken to assure the Run itself was performed in a manner prescribed by the company or by some law or regulation.
    
As will be seen later, the name of the Processes performed in Run is *Routines* as they are done *routinely*.

### Change
Change, Change The Organisation or Transformation, consists of Processes performed to improve or transform the Run such as to:
- Grow output to yield more Revenue (more existing, or new, Services);
- Protect existing Revenue at risk of being lost (due to changes in the Environment like new products issued by Competitors, change in laws etc.);
- Secure the manner in which Services are produced to reduce Risk;
- Optimise the manner in which Services are produced to increase output at constant Cost, reduce Cost, reduce Risk or any combination of these.
  
The difference between Optimise and the three other Change Types is subtle. If one improves a process such that it yields more Services for the same price has one Grown the Run or Optimised the Run. There is no clear cut rule here, but in general, if the intent is to Optimise then any indirect consequence should not drive the Change Type.
  
As will be seen later, the name of the Processes performed in Change is *Projects* as, unlike Routines, they are done as *one-offs*.
   
There is no fixed ratio between Run and Change for any given industry. At average, in the past it was more around 80% Run and 20% Change. Over time this has shifted to 20/80. There are also extreme cases: some companies have a Business Model based on custom made Products, effectively reducing Routines to nearly 0% and Projects to almost 100% of the modus operandi e.g., custom made furniture or cars. In some companies Operations is deemed Run *including* Projects. Furthermore, some Ventures operate according to composite models like Run-Grow-Transform. 
________________________________________
## Resources
Resources are effectively the input and overseers for the Operation's Processes. 
  
There are three deliverables for Resources:
- Staff
- Suppliers
- Assets
  
### Staff
Staff refers to people employed by the Venture i.e., employees, who are directly responsible for the Operation's Processes. To fulfill these, Staff need certain abilities and characteristics:
- Skills
- Knowledge
- Experience
- Personality 
- Performance
   
#### Skills  
A Skill is the learned ability to perform a Process such that the expected Result is yielded within the constraints and dependencies imposed on the execution of that Process. Skills are focused on "doing something". Skills are acquired through study and practice by doing it at home, a club, a classroom setting (school, university, evening school) or on-the-job training. Skills are often divided into two main categories: 
- Soft Skills
- Hard Skills
  
Soft Skills are subjective and hard to quantify. They are often referred to as *people skills* or *interpersonal skills* and are developed over time, sometimes from a very young age. Soft skills are some of the most important skills underpinning good Management, but they are also more difficult to explicitly study or train. Many of below Soft Skills (in no particular order) have dependencies on each other and some are essentially the same but appearing under different names:   
- Communication: ability to convey and share ideas effectively to a wide range of Stakeholders.
- Leadership: ability to help oversee Activities, guide initiatives and steer Staff toward the achievement of Goals through Leading. But also the ability to identify strong performers, and potential strong performers versus weak performers and people without potential.
- Motivation: ability to keep going even in the face of setbacks.
- Flexibility: ability to accept new challenges calmly and without restraint.
- Adaptability: see Flexibility.
- Multitasking: ability to manage different tasks efficiently by prioritising them.
- Time Management: ability to plan different tasks and track them such that they complete at the expected time.
- Problem Solving: ability to analyse a problem efficiently to create a solution, including breaking up larger problems in smaller ones.
- Risk awareness: the ability to recognise the potential for hazards, harm, incidents, losses, etc.
- Imagination: the faculty of forming new ideas, images or concepts of objects not present to the senses.
- Creativity: is the ability to create something new using Imagination, innovation.
- Inventiveness: being innovative, see Creativity. 
- Team spirit: ability and even desire to cooperate with others, the ability to build, and rely on relationships.
- Self-learner: ability to teach oneself new topics by finding and using relevant sources of information adequate for that topic and then studying or practicing them.
- Self-critical: ability to question oneself to improve the quality of one's output and to increase one's understanding of relevant topics 
- Self-starter: ability to see tasks requiring to be done and start working on them without being asked by someone else to do so.
- Analytical: ability to collect, process and transform Data (records of fact) into Information (interpretation of facts) relevant to a topic 
- Strategical: ability to identify potential and actual Opportunities that grow Revenue and/or reduce Cost and/or reduce Risk under the constraints of potential and actual Threats given actual or perceived Strengths and Weaknesses of the Venture. 
  
Hard Skills are abilities that are relatively easy to quantify. They are taught and acquired through books, classroom sessions, internet, but also on the job. Hard Skills are often but not always knowledge based. Hard skills can also be recognised through diplomas and certificates. They include:
- Languages
- Mathematics
- Natural Sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, meteorology, ...)
- Social Sciences (economics, sociology, psychology, ...)
- Information Technology (programming, system design, ...)
- Applied Sciences (all forms of engineering, medicine, ...)
- Accounting 
- Data Science
- Project Management 
- Use of Venture specific Assets
- Use of Venture specific Processes
- ...
- ...
    
#### Knowledge  
Knowledge refers to what is required in understanding topics involved in the Processes and is thus more focused on "understanding something". Knowledge can be obtained through self-study, classroom setting or on the job-training.
  
#### Experience  
Skills and Knowledge can often be 'proven' or 'benchmarked' from having performed Processes requiring the same or very similar Skills and Knowledge. This is referred to as Experience. Experience gives more weight to the relevance of Skills and Knowledge and can be expressed as "Similar role for X years in company Y".
  
#### Personality 
The Personality of a Staff is an important factor in the Staff's ability *to fit in*, and *to grow within* the Venture. Personality is strongly related to the ability to interact with others in a diverse environment. It is not explicitly taught or trained but rather the result of multiple factors like upbringing, education, cultural background, life experiences and life expectations as well as having participated in sports, clubs, extra-curricular activities. Various traits are part of Personality: 
- Altruism: the unselfish concern for the welfare of others, prioritizing others' needs and well-being over one's own, potentially at a personal cost.
- Curiosity: the desire to learn to do something or to know about something
- Being grounded: the state of being down-to-earth, being mentally balanced, understanding the reality of things, being sensible and non-pretentious.  
- Charitability: the ability and willingness to share whilst not having any direct benefit to do so.  
- Stress Management: the ability to deal with adversity
- Empathetic: ability to listen and understand and even share the feelings of someone else.
  
Personality seems very similar to Soft skills (see above), but in the Management Framework Soft Skills are deemed more related to performing work in a certain way, whereas Personality says more how someone approaches life and people within his surroundings in general, not specifically within a work context. Nevertheless, different Venture's may not consider Personality as separate and consider it part of Soft Skills, others may make the distinction. 
  
#### Performance
The combination of above four elements drive the *potential* of a Staff and ultimately yields the Staff's ability to perform. In the Management Framework the concept of a Staff's Performance is measured across three axis:
- Dependability 
- Pro-activity
- Leadership
  
Firstly, dependability is defined as to deliver Objectives (Routines and Projects) on time. Dependability focuses on *What*, *When* and *How* to complete assigned, and thus *known* Objectives and their underlying Processes. It is what most people have in mind when asked to review a Staff's performance. Dependability relates to the Staff's *Competency* which is the ability to carry out Processes effectively, autonomously and timely to yield the expected Result and includes the capacity to: 
- Adhere to the notion of "See the work", defined as "Identifying and following up on a need for effort to help others or oneself to complete a task without having to be told". It is a catchall and may not even be related to Objectives e.g. lifting a glass from a table when someone else cleans the table. It is a mindset thing!
- Act autonomously, which includes knowing which Objectives to own based on Job Description as well as which Processes are involved and need to be executed how and when.
- Take decisions in line with the authority granted with the Staff's role, as formalised in the Job Description (see below).
- Understand Objectives and Processes involved to achieve them as well as the deadlines related to them.
- Understand and consider dependencies on Resources (Assets, Staff and Suppliers) and other Processes (performed by oneself or someone else).
- Plan work according to deadlines and the above understanding.
- Prioritise Objectives according to urgency, quick wins and short/long term priorities, and readjust priorities dynamically based on circumstances.
- Be analytical and pragmatic when assessing information.
- Ask the right questions to the right person.
- Break down complex Objectives in simpler ones.
- Escalate problems arising in completing an Objective.
  
Secondly, pro-activity is to act entrepreneurial i.e., self-initiate Objectives and Goals. Pro-activity focuses on *missing*, *ineffective* or *inefficient* parts of the Venture and includes the capacity to:
- See the bigger picture, being able to zoom-out of Objectives and seeing how Objectives feed into Goals and Goals into the Mission and the Operations overall Results.
- Have a strong focus on final Results rather than only the performance of the Objectives assigned to oneself  
- Understand if and when Results are only partially met and why
- Understand which Objectives and Goals are missing/incomplete such if they were remediated the Results would be achieved.
- Understand Goals of the Venture and how underlying existing Objectives align to that Goal, including Objectives that are not covered by the Staff.
-Ability to see dependencies between Processes and Resources 
- Think out of the box to 
  
Lastly, Leadership is defined as to use leadership principles to initiate new Goals and Objectives as well as to complete existing Objectives more efficiently and understanding the strengths of Groups and Staff in the Venture. Leadership focuses on with *whom* to achieve Objectives and includes the capacity to:
- Drive and motivate others (other Staff, Suppliers) to achieve one's own Objectives
- Listen to others to improve Results, but also to understand concerns and constraints.
- Understand that Staff can still under-perform even if they are very skilled, due to reasons unrelated to the Process requiring those Skills e.g., due to corporate culture, personal circumstances, etc.
- Always approach with "How can I help?'
- Expect different Stakeholders to need a different manner of answers for the same question.
- Work with others in the understanding that achieving Goals and Objectives are a common interest.
- Delegate part or whole of Objectives.
- Use meetings (1:1 Meeting, Team Meeting) effectively 
- Use Communication means effectively (Mail, Chat, face to face).
- Use Feedback to grow others (give feedback) and oneself (collect feedback).
- Understand, respect and use people's natural resistance to change.
- Work towards Psychological Safety.
- Act as a Mentor (Mentoring is a long term Process where a Mentee taps into the skills of the Mentor to develop broadly rather than focusing on specific aspects of the current Role of the Staff)
- Act as a Coach (Coaching is a short term process in which the Coach helps a Coachee to improve specific aspects of the current Role of the Staff)
- Report, unsolicited, on progress to relevant Stakeholders.
  
### Suppliers
Suppliers contribute to the performance of Operations without being accountable for the final Results, but possibly being accoubtable for intermediate Services. Suppliers can be embedded, internal or external (see below). They include distributors, utilities as well as internal Groups. Suppliers can provide raw materials, finished products, commodities like electricity, water as well as intangibles e.g., custody, advisory, etc. Suppliers are closely linked to Assets as they often provide and/or service Assets. The Service and/or Goods to be provided by a Supplier and the commercial terms of that provision are most often bound by a contract or service agreement. Although Suppliers are not held accountable for Operations (Management is), they are accountable for producing the Services or Goods they provide. Finding the best Suppliers and maintaining the relationship and contracts is done by Business Function Procurement.  
   
There are two types of Suppliers: *Internal Suppliers* and *External Suppliers*:
- Internal Suppliers: Suppliers within the Venture i.e., a department deemed a Supplier to other Activities in the Venture.
- External Suppliers: the 'classic' Suppliers outside the Venture including consultants.
  
Other names for Suppliers are *Service Provider*, *Solution Provider*, or *Support Function*. The word Supplier is sometimes interchanged with *Business Partner* or *Partner*. Although Suppliers and Partners both offer Services to a Venture there is a difference which lies in the *relationship* with the Venture. Suppliers provide Services based on a bidding process and for a specific purpose e.g., buying stationary, cleaning services, after which the relationship often ceases to exist until it is required again. Partners, on the other hand, work with Management to optimise Operations such as to achieve the best Services. The relationship with Partners is long-lasting and based on *trust* in addition to the commercial terms. The word Supplier is used throughout this Profile to reflect either.  
  
### Assets
Assets refers to the setup available to Staff and Suppliers, to perform the Processes, including the financial means (Cash) to acquire Assets. Assets can be tangible and intangible. A tangible asset is a physical item including land, building, vehicle, furniture, fixings, server, PC, laptop, cash, receivables, etc. An intangible asset is a non-physical item that has a multi-period useful life like patents, copyrights, client lists, trademarks, brand names, logos, procedures, data, referential data, as well as knowledge developed over time through training, experience and recruitment. Not all intangible assets in this framework can be found on the balance sheet e.g., referential data, procedures or knowledge. Assets from a Balance Sheet perspective are for a large part managed through the Business Function Finance. The purchase of Assets (on Balance Sheet or not) is often managed through Business Function Procurement. Assets often have a dependency on Suppliers which service them.  
  
The scope of Assets in Resources is broader than in Finance. In Finance, *only* those items (tangible or not) owned by the Venture *and* which can be converted to Cash are deemed Assets and will appear on the Balance Sheet. As such, there needs to be a reasonable method to give a monetary value to such Assets. Any such item not deemed an Asset for the Balance Sheet is either an *off-balance sheet* item or is simply not considered at all. For example, within Resources a "procedure" *is* an Asset but in Finance it is not always the case e.g., the Coca-Cola recipe would be an Asset for the Balance Sheet, but the procedure how to clean the drums in which that drink is mixed is not and would not even be recorded under off-balance sheet Assets. 
    
It is possible to hear the term human capital, or "our assets are our staff,", which suggests Staff could be some form of Asset. The Management Framework explicitly makes distinction between the two and thus does not include Staff within Assets. 
   
Key Assets are:
- Accounting Assets incl. Cash
- Infrastructure
- Intangibles
- Data
- Services
    
#### Accounting Assets incl. Cash  
Accounting Assets are those assets officially maintained as such on the Balance Sheet including *Fixed assets*, e.g., buildings and machinery as well as *Current Assets* e.g., Receivables and of course *Cash*. Cash is used to fund ongoing *Operating Costs* i.e., rent, raw material, utilities, etc. Cash is made available from the sales of Services i.e. Revenue and Funding (see Organising later in this note). Accounting Assets are recorded on the left side of the Balance Sheet and are maintained through Business Function Finance, specifically Accounting.
  
#### Infrastructure  
Infrastructure or Infra a.k.a. systems, refers to the physical setup used on a day to day basis whether part of Accounting Assets or not. The term is used mostly in non-manufacturing Ventures in which case it refers to IT infrastructure.
  
#### Intangibles  
This includes assets like goodwill, copyrights, procedures, referential data, etc. that are or are not also Accounting Assets.
  
#### Data  
The terms *Data* and *Information* a.k.a. *Info* are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same. Data, in the Management Framework, is defined as individual facts, while Information is the organisation, interpretation and visualisation of those facts within a relevant context. Data is also an intangible Asset, but has its own classification given its importance. Data is a combination of a physical repository (classified under Infrastructure) and the content held therein. Content can be broken down into two key types: *Structured Data* (spreadsheets, databases,...), and *Unstructured Data* (videos, music, pictures, text, presentations, source code,...). Neither Data nor Information yield truth (an accurate reflection of reality) as such, because both can be subjectively produced (Harari, 2024). However, this note will not enter in that philosophical debate and stick to the simple premise that Managers have an interest to have Data and Information produced such that is as accurate as possible, and it is assumed that Managers do this in the best interest of the Venture.  
    
#### Services  
This refers to Services provided by Suppliers and which are not any of the above e.g., trading venues, catering. cleaning services. Such Services are not recognised as an Asset on the Balance Sheet, but rather generate a Cost on the Income Statement. From an Operations perspective such Services are an Asset as they enable Operations to be performed.  
________________________________________
## Capital
In order to pay for Resources the Venture needs Cash. Cash is obtained through cash from Revenue but is often not available at the time, or in sufficient amount, when required. Overcoming the timing and size differences between needing Cash and sufficient Cash having been generated from Revenue is done through *Financial Capital*, or Capital in short. 
  
There are two key forms of Capital:
- Liabilities
- Equity 
  
### Liabilities
Liabilities a.k.a. Debt is a form of active or passive Funding and consists essentially of different types of Loans. Liabilities are recorded on the right side of the Balance Sheet and are maintained through Business Function Finance, specifically Accounting.
  
Liabilities can take various forms:  
- Short term loans  
- Purchases on credit  
- Bank overdrafts  
- Long term loans   
- Bond Issuance  
  
#### Short Term Loans  
A short term loan is what it says: it is borrowing money to return shortly (days, weeks). Because they are short term there are often less conditions involved. 
    
#### Purchase on Credit  
Credit purchases are a form of passive funding, effectively, a Cash outlay now is deferred to later. 
  
#### Bank Overdrafts  
Overdrafts are a form of active funding and an indirect form of short term borrowing trough the bank.
  
#### Long Term Loans  
Long Term loans can go by different names. Often the amounts are high and are against a single loan issuer or loan writer like a bank. Because of the size, some form of collateral is often required to protect the loan writer.
  
#### Bond Issuance  
A Bond Issuance is a form of long term loan, but instead of being written against a single counterparty it is distributed to many counterparts. Bonds don't involve collateral. 
  
### Equity
The difference between Assets and Liabilities represents the net worth of the Venture called Equity. Equity allows a Venture to generate further Profit as well as to absorb losses. The former can be achieved by reinvesting Profit in one or more aspects of the Operations, thus generating more Revenue or reduction of Cost or Risk. Losses can be absorbed by eating into reserves, suspending dividend payments or writing down equity (Choudhry, 2012). Equity is recorded on the right side of the Balance Sheet and is maintained through Business Function Finance.
   
Equity has several types:
- Preferred Stock
- Shares issued a.k.a. Common Stock
- Retained Earnings
- Reserves 

#### Preferred Stock
Shares issued that rank before Common stock, but after Bonds in case of bankruptcy. They pay dividends, but offer no voting rights.
  
#### Common Stock
Common stock represents basic ownership in a Corporation. It is the residual corporate interest that bears the ultimate risk of loss, as it is subordinate to all preferred stock. Common stock gives voting rights to the holders.
  
#### Retained Earnings
Retained earnings represent the portion of Net Income that has been reinvested  into the business rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends. On the Balance Sheet it represents the amount of profits a company has accumulated over time and has chosen to keep, rather than paying out. 

#### Reserves
Reserves represent a portion of earnings that are set aside for future use, most often for a specific purpose. There are several types of Reserves possible:  
- Revenue Reserves: created from Operations
- Capital Reserves: created from Capital transactions e.g., sale of shares above par value.   
- Legal Reserves: a buffer to be set aside under some law 
- General Reserves: a general buffer not for a specific purpose
   
The Processes involved in issuing shares is discussed in Financing later in this note. Generally speaking, a Manager, in particular at higher levels, is expected to understand the relationship between Assets, Liabilities, Equity and Profitability as well as the different forms of Equity and how they help maintain a financially healthy Venture.
________________________________________
## Results
There are four key results from the performance of the Processes in Operations. Out of the four Revenue is the reason why Venture's exist in the first place (at least for commercial Ventures). Two other monetary Results are Cost and Risk and they are undesired, but unavoidable, consequences of performing Processes using Resources within the constraints imposed on the performance of the Processes, mostly from the Environment. The fourth result is intangible and non-monetary: Image. 
   
### Revenue
Revenue is the principal result of the Run. A good understanding of Revenue drivers and their evolution as well as future expectations of Revenue is key to Management. Although the core activity of a Venture is to generate Revenue from the Run, other forms of Revenue can occur. For example the sale of an Activity may yield Revenue, but will also subsequently yield a loss of Revenue the Activity generated. Revenue is often net of Cost Of Good Sold or other contra revenues, see below. Revenues are recorded on the Income Statement and are maintained through Business Function Finance, specifically Accounting.
  
### Cost
Operations create Cost in different forms:
- Costs of Good Sold: costs directly related to the manufacturing of goods or delivery of Services a.k.a. Operating Fees, Negative Income, Contra-Revenues. In other words: if a Service is not delivered, the cost is also not Incurred, at least in theory. In practice there are production timing considerations which require a purchase of Inventory to be used at one point in time in manufacturing, effectively yielding a Cost without yet having delivered a Product. Such inventory finds its way into the Balance Sheet as an Asset. It is also possible that certain of such Costs of Goods Sold relate to a minimum purchase by the Venture, and thus lead to more complex cost structures. Note that where a COGS, negative Income or Contra-Revenue is incurred, it is often recorded under Revenue (as a negative number, or embedded in the final Revenue amount).
- Operating Costs: costs required to keep Operations up and running like salaries, utilities, rent, licenses, subscriptions, depreciation, etc. These costs are incurred even if a Service is not delivered.
- Other Costs: these include one off costs like fines, impairments etc. 
  
Cost is an undesirable, but necessary deliverable, and its minimisation through Cost Management is an important output of Management. Cost is expressed in reporting currency on the Income Statement, but within Operations it can also be expressed and monitored via proxies like time, man-hours or man-days, head-count, etc. Costs are recorded on the Income Statement and are maintained through Business Function Finance, specifically Accounting.
  
### Risk
Risk reflects the probability of adverse, unplanned -not necessarily unexpected- events that have an adverse outcome and that emerge as a result of Run and Change being performed in a dynamic Environment. More specifically, unplanned events occur as the result of either: 
i) Weaknesses in Run and Change Processes performed or supported by Staff, Suppliers or Assets and/or   
ii) Unforeseen conditions created internally (Management, Staff, Suppliers, Assets) or externally (Suppliers, Clients, and Environment).
   
Ultimately, the adverse outcome can be any or all of the following:
- Decreased Revenue (the Run stops, Services or Goods are destroyed)
- Increased Cost (cost of adding new Processes, replacing or adding Staff or Assets, fines, lawsuits, legal counsel, insurance, ...)
   
The definition of *adverse outcome* is left open to interpretation and ironically, is itself often also probabilistic. For example, an unplanned event may be a critical high pressure hose break. This may stop production for a while which means lack of Revenue (an adverse outcome), and the hose needs to be repaired which means an increased Cost (another adverse outcome). However, how long will the production stop, how much repair is needed? The answers to those questions is often probabilistic. Another case of the probabilistic aspect of adverse outcome is a breach of Regulation, without the actual breach having had any other adverse outcome e.g., a plane did not crash, but an airline company was found to not have complied with regulations set out for maintenance (unplanned event is lack of required maintenance). In this case, estimating the cost of lawyers the potential fine, is all the domain of probability. Note also, that the event itself in this case would materialise only if someone actually noticed it, like a Staff or Manager or through some form of internal or external control e.g., an audit.
  
Management of Operations invariably includes *mitigation* of Risk which consists of Processes put in place to pro-actively-identify zones of Risk and remediate the cause of that Risk. In the case of i) above, Risk Mitigation is often referred to as *Quality Control*, and for ii) it is referred to as *Risk Management*. These two terms are contextual and may this be used differently in different Ventures or even caught under a single denominator. Ultimately, Risk can be seen as a form of *probabilistic* Cost and the mitigation of Risk incurs a *realised* or *actual* Cost e.g., insurance, hedge transactions, backup Assets, more Staff than strictly necessary, fire drills, disaster simulations, training, etc.
  
Several types of Risk exist:
- Strategic Risk: Managerial decisions yielding unexpected Results;
- Financial Risk: Market Risk, Credit Risk, Counterparty Risk, these are risk related to financial products or the solvency of clients involved in (financial) transactions This is very relevant for banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, asset managers, but also corporates that hedge their real world exposure with financial transactions like airlines.
- Operational Risk: risk that Operations yield unexpected Services or byproducts, or don't yield a Service at all, or alternatively result in damage to Resources including Staff (injuries), Assets or Suppliers. 
- Legal Risk: the risk of Operations not being conducted within the laws set out in a given country e.g., employment law.
- Regulatory Risk incl. Tax Risk: a sub-set of Legal Risk. Regulatory Risk is the risk that the Results yielded by Operations create a dispute with an authority (tax authority, regulator, ...) leading to more Cost in the form of legal counsel fees, fines, loss of license to operate, etc. Regulatory Risk is specific to the Sector the Venture Operates in, whereas Legal Risk is often independent of such Business or Sector. 
- Reputational risk: a.k.a. Franchise Risk is the risk that the Image of a Venture is damaged with the result that Clients seek their Services elsewhere. Reputational Risk can be as a result of the Venture itself, but also, indirectly as a result of the actions of one or more Staff in the Venture, or alternatively through Suppliers.  
- Actuarial Risk: specific to the insurance industry, actuarial risk involves the statistics involved in decision taking with regards to loss of life, loss of operations.
- Supply chain risk: concerns interruptions in supply chain either as physical disruption or changes in the cost of using existing supply chains. This could be simply the bankruptcy of a single Supplier, as well as geopolitical disruptions like war with a country that has Suppliers used by the Venture.    
- Cyber Risk: a rather new but rapidly evolving risk facing nearly all private and public institutions in the world. Various types of risk exist, of which the three most important ones are data theft, malware and ransomware. 
- Fraud: any form of deception to gain something unlawfully or at least unfairly, or to deprive an individual in the Venture or the entire Venture some legal right or commercial opportunity. 
- Other: there are Risks often specific to each industry e.g., in biotechnology the risk of a virus escaping.
  
Risk is an undesirable consequence of conducting Operations and Management within a non-controllable Environment. Its minimisation through Risk Management is an important responsibility of a Manager. Risk is also the focus of the Business Functions Risk sometimes also called Quality Assurance or Quality Control.  
It is important to note that depending on the Venture, Risk is fundamental or incidental to the Venture. For example, in Financial Institutions Risk is fundamental and the very active management of Risk is core throughout Operations. The same is true for pharmaceutical, airplane and car manufacturing companies for example. On the other hand for a small furniture manufacturer Risk is more incidental to Operations, and it can be -partially- managed through insurance. 
  
### Image
The Image of a Venture is a non-monetary but potentially crucial Result of conducting Operations. A Venture's Image relates to how Stakeholders, and thus *any people* in the Environment and in the Venture itself *perceive* the Venture as a whole against a wide possible range of metrics relevant to any of those people, like aesthetics of Services, general reliability of the Services or reliability of the Venture on making good on its contractual obligations. It also includes aspects not directly linked to the Services offered like whether the Venture takes care of its employees or whether it cares for the climate or environment, whether it has involvement in financing or otherwise enabling criminal, terrorist, or other malicious entities, etc. There is no well defined scope for Image. However, the notion of Image is key to a Venture, and it is possible that a bad image can break the Venture over time. 
________________________________________
## Management
Management, or Managing, focuses on a person, called *Manager*, proactively and continuously assuring the availability of enough Capital to finance the Cost of Resources that assure the Run and Change of the Operation's Processes in order for Services to be delivered to Clients yielding Revenue whilst containing and reducing Risk.
  
The above summary is essentially an alternative view of the Profile. To achieve it, Management consists of continuously and intermittently performing four *Management Functions* called *Planning*, *Organising*, *Leading* and *Controlling* or *POLC* (Rutter, 2003), (Loyd et al, 2020), (University of Ohio, 2010), (Poff et al, 2023). Whereas the POLC are commonly understood to constitute the four core *functions* a Manager performs, the amount of time spent on each, as well as the detail required to be covered varies depending on the Venture. The Profile aims at defining these four functions more holistically such that it provides guidance to Managers in the context of the overall structure of a Venture. 
  
Management applies part or whole of the four POLC to Operations first and foremost, but also applies them to key topics or themes that affect Operations or the entire Venture transversely. Such themes are, for example, the Financial aspects of running Operations, Human Resources, Risk across all its different angles, or the complex aspects of selling the Services to Clients through Marketing, etc. These themes are commonly referred to as *Business Functions*.  
  
Lastly, in order to achieve the best results, Managers use various Tools in their day to day work. 
    
### Management As Goal  
As discussed in the Profile Overview, Management is one of the four key Run Goals of a Venture. It makes sense to have Management central to the Goals of a Venture, as without Management the Venture will not sustain. 
  
### Management and Resources  
In the Profile Tree, there is no mention of Staff, Assets, or Suppliers under Management. Yet, Management is performed by Staff, requires certain Assets, and often Suppliers are used. Although Management consumes certainly some Assets, this consumption is in general minor compared to Operations. Assets that are specific to Management are the Tools.
     
### Management vs Governance  
Often the term Governance is used separately from, or in combination with, Management. Depending on the context in which these terms are used they mean different things. These different interpretations can be expressed as function of one or more Management Functions. Below follow two interpretations, but others are possible:  
  
- Scholarly view :   
    - Governance = Planning + Organising  
    - Management = Leading + Controlling  
- Risk view:   
    - Governance = Planning + Controlling  
    - Management = Organising + Leading  
  
The distinction between Governance and Management is conceptually not relevant for the Management Framework: Management is holistic and all-encompassing. It is, however, important to realise that some Ventures make such distinction. It is even possible, that Governance is considered a Business Function in some Ventures.
  
### Management vs Leadership  
From a definition perspective, Management is often seen solely as consisting of Planning, Organising and Controlling with a focus on Processes and Assets to achieve Results (Revenue, Costs and Risk) whereas Leadership is seen as an individual's ability to direct, inspire, influence, motivate, and enable Staff to contribute toward the Operations. In short, the main difference between the two is that leadership is about influencing Staff (and Suppliers to a certain extent) to follow, while Management focuses on maintaining systems and processes. Another way of looking at Management and Leadership is that a Manager is given a role as Manager, in other words the hierarchical position the Manager has allows the Manager to direct Staff and expect for that direction to be followed merely because of the position held. Leadership on the other hand can be seen as making Staff achieve the same results not because of a hierarchical position but by a combination of directing, influencing, inspiration and motivation. 
As can be seen from the POLC, Leading or leadership is a fundamental aspect of Management and as such, Management and Leading are intertwined in the Management Framework. Note that one can be good in the POC of Management but not in the L, which makes a less effective Leader. Reversely, a good Leader may not be an efficient Manager.  
    
### Management Level   
A *Management Level* indicates at what level within the organisation Management is performed. Top Management is Management of the entire Venture often represented through so called *C-suite* roles (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc) particularly if it is an incorporated company. Middle Management involves the running of Activities on department or country level, whereas Low-level Management or Line Management relates to teams close to the Processes being performed. Obviously, more granular Management Levels are possible. Ultimately, Top Management effectively delegates (see Organising later in this note), a vast amount of Management Functions to Middle Management and they in turn delegate to Line Management. At each level Management still consists of the four Management Functions, but the lower the level, the more the functions focus on Short Term and Operational aspects and less on Strategic aspects.   
For lower levels Management may not be a full time job, instead it is part of the job, and the Manager may be involved in Operations. This is referred to as a *hybrid Management/Operations* role or a *Hybrid Manager*. Last but not least, the concepts of Management can be used by Directors of the Board of Directors, see under [## Venture].
    
### Management as Academic Topic  
Management has, and still is, the topic of much study and research. The Management Framework does not intent to reflect an exhaustive view of the significant amount of work done over the last 100 years. For example, Henry Fayol (Fayol, 1949) defined five instead of four Management Functions. The fifth one, Coordinating, does not appear as such in the Management Framework and has over time been morphed into the other Management Functions. More importantly, whereas early Management focused solely on the point of view of the Venture and Shareholders, modern Management theory has an increased focus on the interest of Stakeholders more broadly.
    
### Management Principles
There are many books written on Management or Leadership principles e.g., "21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership" (Maxwell, 2007) or Fayol's 14 Management Principles (Fayol, 1949). The Management Framework too defines a few principles deemed relevant for a Manager to achieve his full potential, and for the Venture to thrive.
  
#### Management Principle - Understand the Venture
For a Manager to function at his best, it is fundamental he understands, and maintains that understanding of, the Venture. In other words, *why* does the Venture do what it does. This means an understanding of all aspects of the Profile (Environment, Clients, Services, Operations and Management). This is true for every Management Level, even if the level of understanding of each aspect may differ for each level. Understanding is not the same as knowing, which is the next 
  
#### Management Principle - Know the Venture
Whereas the first principle focuses on the *why* of the Venture. The second principle focuses on *what* actions the Venture performs, and *who* are the key players in the actions performed, and *where* and *when* does the Venture perform these actions and lastly, *how* are these actions performed. This knowledge and the interplay of the different aspects of it is key for a Manager to be able to add value to the Venture.  
  
#### Management Principle - Focus on Results
Always keep the Results (Revenue, Cost, Risk) within the constraints of the Environment as the driving force of the Venture. In other words, if a Goal, Objective, Task or more generally any Process does not increase Revenue, and/or reduce Cost and/or decrease Risk, then that Process should probably not be performed. The exception to this is if said Process is needed to inform Stakeholders of the Results or the manner in which these Results are achieved.  
  
#### Management Principle - Keep it Simple
Complexity is a Cost, and it in addition, it can stun the flexibility the Venture has to deal with Change and more importantly to innovate. Complexity often creeps in over time and even if the direct costs of such complexity is difficult to gauge, Managers should thrive in eliminating complexity in all its forms. This includes simplicity in the organisation (echoing Fayol's unity of command)

Management has the following deliverables:  
- Planning
- Organising
- Leading
- Controlling
- Business Functions
- Tools
- Management Cycle

These deliverables each have a dedicated section (with Tools already having been discussed earlier).  
________________________________________
## Planning
Planning establishes *what is to be done, where, when and why* and also *how*. Within Operations, Planning broadly structures the required Processes to yield the expected Results using available Capital and Resources. It is one of the most holistic Functions within Management and it is forward looking In its approach.
  
This Management Function defines why the Venture exists and which Services need to be delivered now and in the future, in which location and for which Clients as well as how this needs to be achieved. It has a strong focus on the Processes part of Operations.
  
Planning as a Management Function is practically speaking for a large part done by the Manager in isolation. 
  
The following are the fifteen deliverables of Planning:
- Business Model 
- Purpose
- Vision
- Mission
- Values
- Bylaws
- SWOT
- Goals
- Objectives
- Tasks
- Benchmark
- Strategic Plan
- Tactical Plan 
- Operational Plan
- Intel

### Business Model
The *Business Model* a.k.a. *Context* gives the Manager visibility on what the Venture is about, or said differently, what the *Value Proposition* i.e., what aspect(s) about the Service(s), or the way Operations are performed, are a differentiator for Clients. A key input to the Business Model is the result of SWOT (see below). Managers spend considerable time on assuring they know ins and outs of the Venture, constantly collecting information such that a holistic insight can be obtained and formalised in the Business Model. Note that a Business Model is related to, but not the same as *Operating Model* or *Operational Plan*, explained below.
  
### Purpose
A Purpose Statement articulates the *why* of the Venture *now*. It explains the reason of its existence and the impact it wants to make, or in other words, what it does beyond the generation of Profit, *today*. Most Ventures actually do not use Purpose Statements, and they focus on Vision Statements, or they use a Purpose Statement which is really a Vision Statement.

### Vision
A Vision Statement expresses the *why* of the Venture in the *future*. It explains what it thinks the reason of its existence should be and the impact it should have, or in other words, what it should do beyond generation of Profit, *tomorrow*. 

They are often of the form:   To *verb* *object*
  
which is short for: "Our purpose is to verb object."
  
Sometimes the verb object pattern is repeating.
  
Examples (company name, company type):
- To improve the world through trust (Everledger, Technology)
- To make active goals accessible (Sporting Wheelies, Disability Services)
- To simplify technology to empower business (Over the wire, Communications)
- To connect patients to advancements in cancer care (Icon Cancer Foundation, Healthcare)

### Mission
A Mission Statement expresses *how* the Venture achieves the Purpose in the following manner:
  
    "Achieve X by doing Y for the benefit of Z"
    in which: v
    X: What (type of) Services get delivered. 
    Y: How are they delivered (differentiating factors). 
    Z: Whom receives the benefits: Clients or Stakeholders. 
  
The most important one is Y as that sets the Venture apart from Competitors. The differentiating factors can be related to the Service itself (quality, availability, aesthetics, taste, ...), the cost to the Client, or it can be more focused on how the Service is produced (environmentally friendly, with involvement of the Client, etc).
  
### Values
Values reflect what the Venture deems its moral or cultural compass. It can be composed of Values *and* Principles. These are somewhat different in what they mean. Values focus on how to 'be' whereas principles focus on how to 'act' or 'what to do'. Values are opinions and ideas and are thus subjective, and as a result, they can change under different conditions. Principles govern interactions between people, but are more objective. 
  
Values and Principles affect the Venture as a whole and each individual working within or for it like Suppliers. They also set requirements in terms of recruitment. The distinction between Values and Principles may not be made in each company.
  
Examples for LinkedIn:
    - Members first
    - Relationships matter
    - Be open, honest, and constructive 
    - Inspire excellence
    - Take intelligent risks
    - Act like an owner of #OneLinkedIn
    - Embody diversity, inclusion, and belonging
  
### Bylaws
Bylaws represent a broad range of texts that frame the *conditions* under which the Venture *must* operate and how it *must* organise itself. Bylaws represent the Venture's interpretation of laws, rules, regulations and guidelines imposed by the Environment and which effectively provide *boundaries* on Services and Operations. They result from the fact that the Venture operates directly or indirectly in one or more Countries with corporate and tax laws and Sectors that are regulated globally and/or nationally. In addition, Ventures can themselves define rules with regards to what it deems the Venture should comply with even if this is not mandated by any official institution. Often, such Venture imposed rules will also embody the Values mentioned above. The definition of Bylaws is a result from the SWOT process, see below.
  
Examples of Bylaws are Articles of Association, Company Laws, Company Policies, Company Rules, etc.  
  
Obtaining knowledge, and interpretation of applicable laws, rules and regulations is part and parcel of Bylaws. This is often achieved through Business Functions:
- Compliance: regulations specific to the Sector the Services are delivered in
- Risk: laws or regulations w/r to Risk if applicable 
- Legal: corporate law 
- Tax: tax law, applicable to Profit and Salaries
- Human Resources: employment law
- Finance: Financial reporting standards, capital requirements
    
### SWOT
A SWOT, or *Impact Assessment* reviews all internal aspect of the Venture (Operations, Management and their respective deliverables including Services) versus external forces (Clients, Suppliers, Environment and their respective deliverables) to assess to what extent the Venture's *internal* *Strengths* and *Weaknesses* combined with *external* *Threats* and *Opportunities* make the Mission achievable, or more generally enable the increase of Revenue, decrease of Cost and of Risk in a sustainable manner. SWOT is an important deliverable for a Manager as it allows to define how to adjust the Venture to avoid or counter Threats and to take advantage of Opportunities given the Venture's Strengths and Weaknesses. The key inputs to a SWOT are the Operational Plan (or less holistically the Tactical or Strategic Plan) and Intel, both discussed below. SWOT feeds into the Change to seize Opportunities and/or remediate Weaknesses in the Run. Additionally, a SWOT can yield changes in deliverables of the other Management Functions (Organising, Leading and Controlling). SWOT is most impactful when performed as a *continuous process*. SWOT is also the name of a Management Tool for assessing how a Venture is doing. However, in the Profile, SWOT is the name given to *any* process or framework assessing the impact of forces from outside or inside the Venture and the manner in which the Venture adapts through Management. 
    
### Goals 
Goals are outcome statements that define how the Venture is trying to accomplish its Mission and how it tries to align the Mission to the Vision over time. Goals are most often expressed in terms of Revenue, Cost and Risk, and thus indirectly the Services it aims to deliver through Operations. Goals are the overarching driver for Objectives. Goals have the following properties:
1. Clear and unambiguous description of target
2. Measurable
3. Linked to Mission, Purpose and Vision
4. Specify period over which the Goal applies -including indefinitely-
  
Goals, like Services, differentiate between *Run Goals* and *Change Goals*:
  
#### Run Goals   
Run Goals relate to Run Services and are expressed in Revenue, Cost and Risk targets. They constitute, in most cases, the vast majority of work performed in Operations. Run Goals drive Run Objectives. Standard Run Goals in most Ventures are: 
1. Manage the Venture (Management or mgt); 
2. Produce the Run Services (Production or prd); 
3. Oversee Production, a.k.a. Quality/Risk Control (Oversight or ovs); and 
4. Perform Overhead (or ovh), an effort not contributing to any of the above.
    
#### Change Goals   
Change Goals relate to Change Services. Change Goals drive Change Objectives and aim at improving Run Goals. Standard Change Goals are: 
1. Grow Revenue (gro);
2. Protect existing Revenue from changes in the Environment (pro);
3. Secure Operations to reduce Risk (sec); and 
4. Optimise Operations to reduce Cost/Risk and/or increase Revenue (opt). 
  
For both Run and Change Goals alternatives exist and Managers can fill in such Goals any way they seem fit.  
    
#### Sub-Goals  
Sub-Goals can be defined for both Run and Change Goals. Run Sub-Goals regroup Objectives that contribute directly or indirectly to one or more specific Services and can thus reflect specific Activities. Change Sub-Goals can be used as themes Management wants to focus on over a short period of time. In the sections below, if *Goal* is mentioned, it can also mean Sub-Goal. 
   
### Objectives  
Whereas a Goal is broad, an Objective is a precise, time-based Process, or set of Processes, the output of which is measurable and which supports the delivery of a Service and thus contributes to the completion of a Goal. Objectives consume Assets and Suppliers and are performed, or at least initiated by Staff. An Objective is performed within an Activity. Objectives are defined by the 6Ws as follows:
1. What: Unambiguous and measurable, reflected by the name or description of the Objective.
2. When: have a *Start* and *End* date or *Recurrence* and an expected *Effort* and/or expected *Time to Market*.
3. Who: performed by a Staff/Group *and* for the benefit of an Activity, see [## Organising].
4. Why: linked to a Goal i.e., what is the aim of the Objective.
5. How: detailed Processes involved in achieving the Objective.
  
The *Where* aspect is relevant for Venture's where the delivery of Service is not the same as where the Clients are, or where Assets used in Operations are not in the same location as the Venture. If this is not relevant, the *where* can be defaulted to the Venture's or Activity's location. 
  
Objectives are either *Routines* or *Projects*. Both are Measurable and both also have a notion of *Effort*, or time spent involved in performing them, but they differ in property nr. 2: Projects are *limited* in time, whereas Routines are *recurring* in time. They also different in that structurally Projects aim to improve Routines.
  
#### Routines
Routines are composed of one or more Processes performed on a periodic basis that contribute to a Run Goal. Routines do not have an End Date and are thus never completed, even if the Process(es) the Routines are composed of complete each time the Routine is performed. Periodicity can be short term (minutes, hours, days), medium term (weeks, months) to long term (quarters, years) or ad hoc i.e., they start when a trigger event occurs e.g., a request is raised.
   
Once a Routine is started it can take seconds to several weeks or even months to complete. Effectively, in certain cases Routines can behave like Projects in that they have a start date (trigger date) and an end-date (completion date). For example, a custom production company (custom car, custom furniture, etc.) will take several weeks if not months to design and build i.e., behaves like a Project potentially including a Plan, resource allocation etc. What sets Routines apart from Projects is that the former are part of the Run, i.e., the Revenue generating cycle, whereas Projects are part of Change.
  
Routines can be broken down into one or more *Subs* (sub-routines) which each can be further broken down into one or more *Drills*. This allows building a hierarchy as follows:
  
Venture
    Run Goal
        Run Sub-Goal    
            Routine
                Sub
                    Drill
  
Such *Routine Hierarchy* enables a detailed level of Planning where desired (which also means more maintenance). 
   
#### Projects 
Projects are composed of one or more Processes that contribute to Change Goals by being performed as a one-off. They start at one point in time and complete by an end date. The aim of Projects is to change the Run in one of two manners:
- Add new Routines to the Run (scope Change)
- Alter existing Routines to make the Run efficient (efficiency Change). Efficiency leads to improved Services and/or reduced Assets and/or reduced Suppliers and/or reduced Staff and/or reduced Effort. These reductions can be achieved through:
    - Deleting Processes or entire Routines
    - Automating Processes in Routines
    - Centralise Processes for several Routines
    - Simplify Processes in Routines
  
Note that for a Process, or group of Processes, to be considered a Project it needs to effectively change the Run. Work asked to be done at one point but which does not factually change the Run is actually a Routine with an ad-hoc trigger date, even if it occurs only once.
  
Projects can be further broken down into one or more *Streams* which each can be broken down into one or more *Actions*. This allows building a hierarchy as follows:
  
Venture
    Change Goal
         Change Sub-Goal
            Project
                Stream
                    Action
  
Such a *Project Hierarchy* enables a detailed level of Planning where desired (which also means more maintenance). 
  
Goals (incl Sub-Goals) and Objectives combined serve to:
1. Gauge and report performance
2. Drive and improve performance
3. Align effort across the Venture, and
4. Manage accountability within the Venture. 
  
The definition of, and change in Goals (incl Sub-Goals) and Objectives as well as Management in general are a consequence of SWOT.
   
NB: Services, Vision, Mission, Goals and Objectives are intertwined: setting Goals and Objectives defines the Services that will be delivered. In fact Goals are expressed as the performance of specific Objectives to achieve those Services. On the other hand Services that should be delivered are shaped by Clients which in turn drive the Mission from which follow Goals and Objectives, as it drives the longer term Vision.
  
### Tasks
Tasks are similar to Objectives but on a smaller scale i.e., there are Tasks that are more like Routines and Tasks that are more like Projects. Tasks can also be used to reflect specific Processes within Routines or Projects without necessarily breaking those down in Subs/Streams and Drills/Actions. Alternatively, Tasks can also reflect work to do without being specific on whether it is an Objective or whether it is part of a Goal or whether it contributes to a Service. Effectively, Tasks are really a catch-all for "things to do" without the formalism of Objectives. They do not need to be defined for a Venture to exist, but they may help defining smaller scale Ventures or Activities within Ventures. 
  
### Benchmark
Planning defines *metrics* that express *criteria* to assess if, and how well, an Objective, Sub-Goal, Goal within the Strategy was achieved. Such metrics are referred to as Benchmark and they are used in Controlling to establish whether the Planning yielded the expected results. Benchmarks come in a wide range of types. Below often used ones:
- KPI: Key Performance Indicator. A metric used for Revenue, Cost and Balance Sheet tracking. However, it can also measure aspects indirectly related to these monetary deliverables, but rather aspects related to Services e.g., number of Clients onboarded per period.
- KRI: Key Risk Indicator. A metric used to reflect Risk (probability of an adverse outcome, reflected as monetary number) or the actual realisation of Risk i.e., the Risk has materialised. This metric can have many different categories, due to the broad range of possible Risks, see also [### Risk] earlier.
- KEI, Key Efficiency Indicator. A metric used to reflect how well a Venture uses it's Resources versus the Revenues it generates at the Cost it incurs under the constraint of Funding. In many cases KPI will be used to reflect *any* metric related to efficiency. 
- KCI: Key Conduct Indicators show how well Staff perform with regards to the Values. 
- Other: in reality many metrics are possible to measure directly or indirectly any aspect of the Profile Tree.
     
A Benchmark also includes the expected *type of metric* e.g., binary (done, vs not done), quantitative (100 EUR, 1000 lines of code,...) or qualitative ("glossy", "pleasing to the eye", "increased sales") with a preference for quantitative metrics.
Although Benchmarks are mentioned as a separate deliverable in Planning, they are often established as a result of defining Objectives, Sub-Goals and Goals. The "What" aspect of an Objective mentioned above, if well defined, often automatically establishes the Benchmark.
  
At this stage it is worthwhile mentioning a potential conflict of interest in the establishment of Benchmarks and the people establishing them. If a Manager establishes an Objective and then defines a 'weak' or 'easy' Benchmark such that achieving the Benchmark becomes relatively easy, he can be said to lower the standards of the Venture, see also [### Agency Problem]. It is therefore often desirable that an independent or higher level Management reviews and validates the Benchmarks i.e. typically a Board of Directors in the case of a Corporation. Independent establishing or vetting of Benchmarks is part of Managerial Oversight, see also Controlling. 
  
### Strategic Plan
Strategic Plans include Purpose, Vision, Mission, SWOT and Goals and possibly Sub-Goals. It is long term (3 years or more) and is descriptive, and may include some long term Benchmarks. The Strategic Plan is defined by senior management.
  
### Tactical Plan 
A Tactical Plan aims at showing a high-level timeline for Goals and Objectives over a shorter period than the Strategic Plan (often 1-3 years). They are more precise than a Strategic Plan and show *what* will be achieved *when*. The Tactical Plan can cover all four Management Functions, but is mostly focused on Planning and Controlling. Depending on the manner in which Management wants to focus on specific themes within the Tactical Plan, the use of Sub-Goals may be used extensively. Tactical Plans often include Benchmarks to be able to measure and report on realisation of the plan.
  
### Operational Plan
An Operational Plan a.k.a. Operating Model describes *how* the Tactical Plan, or in absence of it, the Strategic Plan, is achieved. More specifically, it explains *how* and *when* Assets and Suppliers are used by Staff to achieve both Run and Change Goals through the realisation of specific Objectives, generating Services ultimately yielding Revenue at some Cost and Risk. An Operational Plan contains often *all* aspects of the Profile Tree from Environment to Operations. As the focus is on the aspects of Operations, items like Mission, Vision, Values are often omitted but can, if desired, be included. Benchmarks may or may not be integrated in this plan. The level of detail of an Operating Model can be high, for example it can contain details of how Staff communicate, how they are organised in terms of seats, how requests are managed, how infrastructure is implemented, how that infra is supported, how Staff is trained, etc. The level of detail can also vary by Activity.   
As a result of being all encompassing, the Operational Plan cannot be defined before Organising, Leading and Controlling, but instead is defined iteratively throughout Management. The Operational Plan can take in details from the various business functions e.g., details of supply chain from Procurement. The Operational Plan should also include the concept of resilience which is the Venture's ability to withstand abrupt or dramatic changes in its Environment yet still function. As such, the Operational Plan is truly a blueprint of Operations of the entire Venture. The Operational Plan feeds into the SWOT as the most detailed level of the Venture's internal workings. 
  
### Intel
Intel or intelligence is the collection of information of military, political, economical, financial, scientific, technological of generally operational or strategic value. Intel is composed of two types: Venture Intel and Market Intel.
  
#### Venture Intel
Venture Intelligence, Venture Intel or Internal Intel represents any form of Intel generated *within* the Venture. This goes across all internal aspects of the Profile Tree i.e., everything except for the Environment. It thus includes Intel from staff, Groups, Suppliers and Management and of course the Business Functions.
   
#### Market Intel 
Market Intelligence or Market Intel is external data generated *outside* the Venture. This data can be used for three purposes:
1. Comparison of Venture versus Competitors in terms of all aspects of Operations and Services.
2. Insight in the positioning of the Venture in the market it operates in.
3. Obtaining insight in where the Environment is going as a whole and which may force, the Venture to accommodate its plan, or it may create an opportunity for the Venture to seize.
  
Market Intel is a key contributor to the Strategy of the Venture. It feeds directly into SWOT, and more holistically, it gives a continuous feedback loop w/r to Goals and Objectives as well as input to the Strategy of the Venture. Market Intel may lead to renewed Vision, Mission, Goals and/or Objectives (mostly Projects) to steer the Venture according to the intel gathered and processed. 
There are different sources for Market Intel: newspapers, ex-colleagues, journals, academic research, consulting companies, head-hunters, magazines, websites, etc.
Critically, Market Intel also includes any sudden change in the environment that forces the Venture to react directly, and in a non-planned manner e.g., an incident at a competitor that puts a lot of negative news on the entire sector both the Venture and competitor operate in. 
________________________________________
## Organising
Organising establishes *how to do it* as in, how to do what was determined in Planning *and* being able to sustain it financially. It is forward looking in its approach. Within Operations, Organising broadly structures Resources and Capital to fit the Plan. In other words, Organising defines how Staff, Assets and Suppliers are organised and assures Capital is well-structured and available to deliver the Strategy defined in Planning. The result is an Organisation in which Staff know what to do and how, using Assets and Suppliers funded by sufficient Capital. Organising has a strong focus on the Resources and Capital part of Operations. 
  
Key deliverables of Organising are:
- Activities
- Groups
- Roles & Responsibilities
- Casting
- Funding
   
### Activities
An Activity is essentially a container of Objectives that work towards delivering one or more Services that are similar and/or related. Often this means that an Activity is framed by one or more Activity-specific Sub-Goals. Activities can roll up into other Activities, called regrouping or grouping of Activities. Grouping of Activities also includes the assessment of whether certain Activities should be outsourced outside of, or internally within the Venture, through Suppliers. Activities are linked to Groups, see below.  
  
There are many Activities required to fulfill the Operations. Each such Activity can have many aspects: 
- Output: the Services being delivered (internal to other Activities or external to Clients). 
- Clients: the receiver of the Services: other Groups within the Venture or Clients. 
- Group: the Group that performs the Activity. 
- Assets: the Assets necessary to perform the Activity.
- Supplier: Suppliers providing input to the Activity.
  
Sometimes an Activity is transverse, i.e., it provides an Output relevant to many other Activities.  
  
### Groups
Once relevant Activities have been identified, Staff performing the same Activity can be identified and grouped. Note the use of *relevant*: It is possible to break work down in many different Activities but it has to be relevant to the Planning. 
The *Grouping of Staff* for the purpose of a specific Activity results in Groups and different names exists for them: teams, department, etc. Groups can roll up into other Groups which is called regrouping e.g., several Teams can be part of a Division etc. The total structure of all Groups is called the Organisation of the Venture and the relation between them is reflected in an *Organisation Chart* or *Org Chart*. Groups permeate all Management Functions and as such are an important deliverable. 
  
For each Group the following aspects can be relevant: 
- Activity: the Activity or Activities performed by the Group. 
- Skills: the type of Skills required for a Group
- Manager: the name of the Manager for the Group, the person ultimately accountable for the performance of the Activity associated to the Group.
   
In most cases an Activity equals the Group associated to it. In other words, the Activity is determined by the existence of a Group of Staff performing Processes relevant to that Activity, and vice versa the Group of Staff performing those Processes reflects the Activity. As such, above properties of a Group can be omitted and one can refer to the Activity. The details for Activity and Group can thus effectively be merged. Groups form the link between Activities and Staff. Therefore, the regular review of Groups implies regular review of Staff within the Group.
  
### Roles and Responsibilities
Once Activities have been identified and Groups have been defined, Staff need to be made aware of what is expected of them within the Group. This is defined through Roles & Responsibilities which formalises the Role of the Staff within a Group and the Responsibilities assigned to that Role through *delegating* a.k.a. *delegation*. Roles & Responsibilities is thus a formalised structure composed of:
- Delegating
- Roles
- Responsibilities
- Job Description 
- Other Roles
  
#### Delegating
Delegating is a key concept (strictly speaking a Definition) in the design of a Venture, defined as:
1. The act by which a *Delegator* (mostly the Manager)
2. gives *Responsibility* for *completion of a Process* to 
3. a suitable *Delegatee* (Staff), including 
4. the *Authority* that goes with said Responsibility 
5. which bestows upon the Delegatee *Accountability* to the Delegator for the Result of said Process, yet
6. without the Delegator losing the original *Accountability* which
7. requires *Oversight* from the Delegator over the Delegatee.
  
The singular *Process* above can be read as an Objective, an Activity or the entire Venture.
  
The Responsibility to perform a Process requires Authority which is the power or right to give orders and expect them to be obeyed (exact obedience), commit Resources (Staff, Assets, Suppliers), and make decisions. Clearly defined Authority is key in the ability to achieve the Result expected from the Responsibility of performing a Process. This goes two ways: 
1. The Delegatee knows which Authority was delegated; 
2. Staff, Groups and Suppliers subject to the Authority effectively know the Delegatee has obtained that Authority.
   
Once Responsibility has been Delegated, the Delegatee is automatically bestowed with the Accountability to *discharge the Responsibility* i.e., for the delivery of the Result of the Process. Accountability means one is liable to report to someone (Manager, CEO, Board of Directors, Shareholder, etc.) on the Result, including timeliness, of a Process and face some form of consequence if it is not achieved, and some form of praise if it is. Note that one can delegate Responsibility and Authority, but one *cannot* delegate Accountability! In other words, a Delegator *can* delegate Responsibility (and the Authority that goes with it), from which automatically flows the fact that the Delegatee owes Accountability to the Delegator. However, a Delegator *cannot* delegate that Accountability on a standalone basis i.e., cannot make a Delegatee accountable for a Process for which the Delegator has *not* delegated Responsibility nor Authority to the Delegatee. This makes sense: being held liable for something over which one has no influence, and provides no direction would be unfair, and legally impossible.
   
As part of the overall Accountability the Delegator performs Oversight of the Delegated Process, and thus the Delegatee, to assure the expected Results have been obtained *and* in return to be able to report to the person who delegated the Process to the Delegator etc. Because Managers delegate many Processes to their reporting Staff they need perform Oversight by design of their role. As such, Oversight is an integral part of Management Function Controlling.
   
In order to delegate a Process, the Authority that goes with a Responsibility must *permit* Delegation to take place. Without such permission a Process cannot be delegated.
  
A Manager who has been delegated a Responsibility and Authority can delegate to someone else, provided that the Authority permits it. This is called *sub-delegation*.
  
A Manager can choose not to delegate i.e., to *retain* Responsibility and also Authority. A Manager can also claim responsibility back, a.k.a. to *revoke* Responsibility and Authority.
   
It is technically possible to delegate Responsibility without also delegating Authority, resulting in *Accountability without Authority*. This is not desirable, but it happens. It essentially means that the Delegatee will depend on the Delegator to get access to Resources, and to use the Delegator to exact obedience (this is where the concept of a *sponsor* comes in in Project Management for example).
*Escalation* is the process of moving up the delegation tree to a level of Authority that is able to make a decision, commit resources or otherwise enforce obedience, because the person escalating does not have the Authority to do that him/herself.  

Last but not least, often Managers do not explicitly delegate Responsibilities to Staff within the Group they are the Manager for: Responsibilities are often delegated by design of the Activity organisation within the Venture. Although this is not a restriction, it does mean that Managers may not always be aware of Responsibilities being fulfilled (or not!) within the Activity they are being held Accountable for.
    
In summary, when delegating Responsibility and Authority for a Process the Delegator remains accountable for the Result to whomever the Delegator is accountable to (Manager, CEO, Board of Directors, Shareholders,...), whereas, at the same time, the Delegatee becomes responsible for assuring the Process delivers the expected Result using the Authority granted and in doing so automatically becomes Accountable to the Delegator with regards to said Result.
    
The above explains the fundamental concepts of delegating. There exist some subtleties. One is that Responsibility (and Authority) can be bestowed upon a Group instead of an individual Staff. This then means, in theory at least, that the Group is accountable. This Accountability sits in reality with the Manager of the Group, not the entire Group. 
  
#### Roles
The Role of a Staff is indicative of two key aspects from the concept of Delegating discussed above: Responsibility and Authority. The Role is most often formalised with a combined Job Title and Corporate Title. A Job Title is a short label indicating what type of Processes (or Objectives or entire Activities) the Role is responsible for and potentially what type of Authority goes with that e.g., Head of Design. The Corporate Title implies both a level of seniority in that Role as well as Authority that comes with it e.g., Associate, Vice President, Senior Vice President, Director, Managing Director, President, etc. A Role helps convey an overall idea of the level of Responsibility delegated to the Staff for a specific or broadly defined functional scope. In addition, it helps defining what type of Responsibilities can be delegated to Staff holding that Role. This is particularly useful for Managers. It is possible to have more than one Role within a Group or across Groups! A well defined Role contains both Job Title and Corporate Title, and it also explains in just a few words the Responsibilities from a high level.
   
#### Responsibilities
Where the Role is high level and indicative, the actual Responsibilities detail what it is that Role is really responsible for. It also clarifies the Authority the Role is granted to exact obedience i.e., whom should execute instructions given by the Role, and for what type of Processes. Clearly defined Responsibilities are important for two reasons: a) the obvious one of making sure what it is a Staff is expected to do, and b) less obviously, clarifies also what the Staff is *not* supposed to do. For a Manager clearly defined Responsibilities enable to assign work by delegating to the best suited Staff or Group.
  
#### Job Description
The Job Description or *JD* is a document that formalises the Roles and Responsibilities in the context of the Venture. It often gives a high-level description of the Venture in which the Activity operates and a more detailed description of the Activity in which the Role as well any expected interactions with peers in the Group and/or other Groups. In addition, a JD also details required Skills, Knowledge and Experience but often not Personality, see Staff above.
  
#### Other Roles
It is possible that various positions are held either within or outside the Venture that do not directly contribute to the Job Description. The scope is broad but can include memberships of clubs within the Venture or, positions held outside organisations representing the sector the Venture is part of, or positions held within other Ventures e.g., Director on the board of a non-competing organisation. Although such roles do not directly contribute to the Venture they can contribute to Skills and Experience and  well-being of people or allow them to get a different experience and grow their Skills which in turn may be beneficial to the Venture. 
  
### Casting
Casting is the Process of finding or allocating the right individual for a given Role, or finding a suitable Supplier for an Activity. In other words, it is about finding the right fit. This deliverable is sometimes also called *Resource Allocation* or more crudely *Hiring & Firing*. Casting is complex because not only do the actual Roles & Responsibilities (or entire Activities in the case of Suppliers) need to be considered, but also other aspects that are less well defined. Notably the Casting of Managers is more difficult, as they need to portray various Skills implicit to a Management function.  
  
### Funding
Funding is the Process of assuring the right level of Capital is available to fund the Resources. It is an important aspect of starting a Venture but also to continue the Venture, also known as the *going concern* principle. For Top Management level this involves decisions on relation to issuing shares, buying back shares, issuing debt etc. For Middle Management this is more about assuring the right amount of Capital is allocated to the Activities they oversee. For Line Management the notion of Funding may or may not exist, and is often mostly focused on making sure Middle Management is aware of funding needs. Funding at Line Management level is sometimes expressed in terms of manpower instead of Capital. Funding can be seen as part of the Business Function Finance, specifically the deliverable Financing. However, where Financing provides advice on most optimal structures to fund the Venture, Funding under Organising ultimately assures sufficient Capital is available to fund the Resources. 
________________________________________
## Leading 
Leading *drives* and *motivates* those *who do it*. Within Operations, Leading drives notably Staff, but also Suppliers, to achieve the Operations' Results set out in Planning given the Organisation created to achieve them. It is both forward and backward looking in its approach.
  
This third Management Function directs, influences, and motivates Staff and Suppliers to perform the Processes as per the Planning within the Organisation. It can rely on the Authority attributed to Managers within the Roles & Responsibilities assigned in Organising, but also involves social and informal sources of influence to inspire others whilst considering concerns and issues the Staff and Suppliers encounter. Effective Managers lead Staff and Suppliers mostly through motivation to progressively attain the Objectives set out in Planning by maximising the aforementioned potential of Staff which consequently maximises the Staff's Performance and ultimately the Results. 
    
Leading is often seen as a different manner to realise Objectives than Managing which can rely heavily on the concept of Delegating. However, in the broader context suggested above, Leading and Managing go hand in hand. In effect, leadership involves a manner of *interacting* with Staff that is less based on a hierarchical position or authority (established in Organising) and more on an approach based on interpersonal skills. Leading, more than Managing, is key to drive Change in modern organisations. 
   
Change is the paradigm of Management in modern days. It is impossible for most Ventures to survive without a near continuous adaptation to a changing Environment: new and improved technology, changing demands, ever evolving constraints (social, economical, regulatory, political, fiscal). Change is a necessity for many reasons but also often viewed as a constraint or stifling force. Leaders propose and guide change throughout a Venture. By growing ideas, knowledge and individuals new Leaders will emerge within the Venture and prepare it for the future. Leading has a strong focus on Resources and specifically Staff within Operations.
  
Note that none of the Key Deliverables for Leading are tangible nor easily measurable, unlike the deliverables for Planning, Organising and Controlling.
  
Key deliverables of Leading are:
- Safe Space
- Direction
- Collaboration
- Motivation
- Inspiration
- Learning
- Networking 
- Leaders
- Management Improvement

### Safe Space
Safe Space involves two aspects: General Safe Space and Psychological Safety. The former is the overall approach of a group of people towards subjects like inclusion, appreciation across all possible subjects of difference: gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, politics and more generally different perspectives. Psychological Safety refers to the belief that the work environment is safe for interpersonal risk taking. This refers to the experience of feeling able, and even obligated, to speak up with ideas, criticism, concerns or questions without risk i.e., without being scorn, seen as incompetent, ignorant, disruptive, betraying trust of the team etc. Psychological Safety is present when colleagues trust and respect each other and feel able, even obligated, to be candid. It is the responsibility of a Manager to assure a Safe Space is created such that all Staff are aware and can, and will, use it as intended.
  
### Direction
Directing is the Process of guiding, inspiring, overseeing and/or instructing Staff towards accomplishment of the Venture's Goals and more specifically Objectives. It is the responsibility of a Manager to assure Direction is shared with all Stakeholders: Staff, Groups of Staff, Suppliers, senior Managers and Shareholders. 
  
### Collaboration
Collaboration is the Process of two or more people working together to achieve an Objective. People can be Staff but also Suppliers. Collaboration, a.k.a. Teamwork is a catalyst for knowledge sharing and creation. This in turn positively affects Motivation. It is the responsibility of the Manager to assure Collaboration is facilitated such that all Staff use it as an integral part of Operations.
  
### Motivation
Motivation is the Process of stimulating Staff to act in a *specific manner* to achieve Objectives. Motivation is a key driver for the success of a Venture. Motivated Staff are more likely to:
- Have a higher propensity to contribute to Safe Space
- To drive Collaboration, and thus 
- To to drive Innovation
- To take responsibility and become the Leaders of tomorrow
- To stay with the Venture for longer
  
It is the responsibility of the Manager to assure Motivation of Staff is achieved throughout the lifetime of the Venture.
  
### Inspiration
Unlike Motivation, inspiration is the Process of influencing Staff emotionally and mentally to be *creative*. As such, Inspiration is a key deliverable to yield Change. In fact, rather than asking for a specific Change through Motivation, Manager's can generate Change, without asking, by Inspiring.
It is the responsibility of the Manager to assure Staff is inspired throughout the lifetime of the Venture.
  
### Learning
Any Venture will undergo Change and in order to accommodate that the entire Venture often needs to learn new aspects of one or more items of the Profile Tree. Often this relates to Technology, which grows at a fast pace, but it also includes changes in Management theory, including Leading. 
  
### Networking
The multitude of people to interact with in and outside of the company requires structure. This structure is achieved through Networking, which achieves two related objectives:
1. Obtain clear insight in who is who in relation to the Venture (Staff, Suppliers, Clients), including outside of the Venture i.e., within the Environment (shareholders, competitors, peers, industry groups, etc). This insight includes relevant knowledge of each person, how they relate to others in and outside of the Venture. 
2. Use the insight within Management i.e., lead, escalate, collect intel, ...
  
### Leaders
A key deliverable for Managers, is to help groom the Managers of tomorrow. Managers need to know how to lead, and they also need to prepare the new Managers for the future. This is done through identification of potential Managers -including outside if the Venture- and grooming them.

### Management Improvement
Good leadership involves assessing one's own strengths and weaknesses and overcoming the latter. This involves taking feedback from Stakeholders and using it to improve.

Through its deliverables Leading contributes to the following in Operations: Staff and Suppliers.
________________________________________
## Controlling
Controlling establishes *how well it was done*. Within Operations, Controlling establishes that the Operations' Results are achieved as per Planning given the Organisation and after Leadership having been applied. It is backward looking in its approach. The focus of Controlling is on Results within Operations. 
  
This fourth Management Function continuously measures Results versus the Benchmark determined in Planning, and adjusts where necessary through the other Management Functions: Planning, Organising and Leading. 
  
Controlling is performed through the concept of a *Control*, which involves 7 steps: 
1. Establish the *Purpose* of a Control;
2. Establish *Baseline* or Benchmark (mostly done in Planning); 
3. Get *Measurement* of the output of Processes i.e. the Result;
4. Perform a *Comparison* of Measurement vs Baseline;
5. Perform an *Analysis* of differences from the Comparison and, if relevant;
6. Define some form of *Remediation*;
7. Keep a *Written Trail* of 1-6 and use it to *Report* and track Remediation.

The Control's Purpose, is fundamental: Ii sets out what a Control aims to achieve and why that is relevant. Particularly for Staff (or other Stakeholders) who are not privy to all details of Operations a Purpose helps setting the stage for understanding steps 2 to 6 and, more generally, facilitates the performance of Controls without needing to acquire all background knowledge. This is particularly important for Checks, see below. 
  
The Benchmark establishes *expected* Results from the Objectives. Most often, the Benchmark is established in Planning at the same time as the Objectives.
   
Depending on the Objective, Measurement requires a clearly defined Process describing how to measure the outcome of Objectives i.e., how to collect Data, how to create Information from the data to perform the actual Measurement,  etc. 
  
The Comparison of the Measurement versus the Benchmark can be expressed as count, percentage etc. and this can be done in tables, graphs or any format that makes the Comparison easy to interpret.
  
The Analysis consists of reviewing the Comparison and drawing conclusions as to how well the Objective was achieved. Analysis as a Process can be simple, but for certain Objectives filtering, discarding outliers etc. may be required. Analysis should yield conclusions as to *why* there are differences between Measurement and Benchmark. The *why* should be explained as part of the Process to achieve the Objective either because of issues within the Process or because other Processes negatively (or positively) affecting the Objective's Process. 
Assuming a measurements not in line with the Benchmark is deemed a *breach*, then the analysis can yield four fundamental outcomes, out of which only the first two are desired measurements (from a statistical perspective). 
1. True Positive: the breach has been correctly identified i.e., a breach was found, and it is a breach. 
2. True Negative: the lack of  breach has been correctly identified i.e., a breach was not found, because there was no breach. 
3. False Positive: a breach has been incorrectly identified i.e., a breach was found, but it is not a breach.
4. False Negative: a lack of breach has been incorrectly identified i.e., a breach should have been found but wasn't.
   
Remediation consists of defining actions from the conclusions from Analysis, including improvement of the Control process itself (to solve False Positives and False Negatives). These actions need integration in Planning, Organising and/or Leading.   
    
Note that above Control logic focuses on Results. It is, however, possible to Control the Input as well as the manner the Result is achieved i.e. the Steps of the Process. In addition, the approach described above can be performed on a granular level as well as a higher level. As such it is possible to perform Controls on Input, the Steps and/or Result of individual Processes, of Objectives, or of entire Goals! When applied on a granular level it is often called Quality Control.  
  
Key deliverables of Controlling are:
- Journal
- Supervision 
- Reports
- Monitoring
  
### Journal
A Journal reflects the result of Journaling which is the Process of ongoing recording of relevant topics in a Journal as Journal entries, which is similar to a ship's log book. For the purpose of Management this  includes *all* topics that occur throughout Management i.e., Journaling is *not* limited to Controlling. Well established Journaling aids in *all* Management Functions. Journaling can be time intensive, depending on how much of it the Manager does versus how much the Manager has it done for him by someone. Another factor is the format of Journaling; using pen and paper, spreadsheets, databases, etc.   
  
### Supervision 
The various steps of Controlling, described above, are fundamentally captured in Supervision. Supervision can be applied to every part of the Venture. The manner in which Managers decide to assure Supervision is done through a Supervision Framework. The Supervision Framework frames which *Supervision Processes* or *Controls* are applied to which *Supervision Scope*. There are four Control types: *Check*, *Review*, *Attend* and *Audit*. All except Attend are both a noun and a verb. Attend is a verb, the noun being Attendance. Supervision can be done through all or only a few Control Types. 
  
#### Check 
A Check consists of the full Control cycle described above i.e., understanding the purpose of the Control to be performed, verify the result of a Process against a predetermined threshold and remediate if there is a deviation. This has a strong focus on *avoiding Risk* or *assure Service quality*. Checks can be performed continuously or periodically. Continuous checks tend to be embedded within an Asset or Routine. Periodic Checks are performed with a predefined recurrence, and can also verify the *efficiency* of continuous Checks. In most businesses, when the word Control is used, it often means Check in terms of this Management Framework.
  
#### Review
A Review is a verification of the Result of a Process against a Manager's (or other relevant Staff's) opinion based on experience and knowledge and potentially some Benchmark. Reviews can be less formalised than Checks. A Review is an often used method to verify progress (Performance) and/or zones of risk within Operations and/or Management and/or Clients in combination or not with the Environment (Market Intel). A Review may also act as a validation as part of a mandatory step in a broader Process. Note that the Process for Review may differ on a case by case basis. Review, is mostly performed periodically. Unlike Checks, Reviews rely on a more holistic knowledge of the Processes being reviewed as well as the Activities those Processes are part of. When doing a Review, the second step, Establish Baseline, is replaced by that holistic knowledge. 
  
#### Attend 
To Attend is similar to Review except that the Manager's opinion is replaced by a attending a (recurring) meeting. In such a meeting the single opinion is replaced by the opinion of relevant people in the meeting. Such meetings are most often referred to as a *Committee* but other names are possible. Attendance includes the preparation of a Committee. Certain committees e.g., Board of Directors are highly formalised and scrutinised. 
  
#### Audit
An Audit consists of an independent verification of part or whole of the Profile i.e., not just Results of Processes but also the Processes themselves. Audits are done by a Group not directly related to either Operations or Management. Such Group is often a permanent establishment within a Venture in which case it is called, Audit Department or Internal Audit (IA). It is, however, possible that the performer of the audit is external to the Venture i.e., an external auditor.   
An Audit uses a broad range of Processes to obtain results that provide sufficient insight. Audits verify Processes and/or Results of such Processes and work against a broad range of Benchmarks defined at the start of the audit e.g., revenue targets, regulatory obligations, and/or Routine execution time etc. Unlike the previous Monitoring types, Audits are mostly ad-hoc and can be considered a Project.
  
Supervision Processes can result in a need for improvements which are addressed through Projects. Supervision Processes are applied to the *Supervision Scope* which refers to what it is the Managers want to supervise. In general. the Supervision Scope is the entire Venture, specifically Operations, against the backdrop of the constraints imposed by the Environment. However, depending on the manner in which a Venture is run, Managers may choose to use a different categorisation of the Supervision Scope with the ultimate objective to still cover Supervision of the Operations. 
  
The output of the Supervision Framework i.e., Supervision Processes or Controls applied to the Supervision Scope is used by the Manager to make decisions. Dissemination of the results from Supervision can be done through various, potentially complementary means: reports, mails, committees, on-line dashboards, etc. 
  
#### Managerial Oversight
One aspect of Supervision is independence of Supervision. Managers define Objectives, Sub-Goals, Goals and Strategies and these include Benchmarks and by measuring what they have defined themselves they may have a conflict of interest. One way around this is the use of Audit as a form of Control (as Audits are independent). The other measure against such conflicts of interest is independent oversight from other managers e.g., a company's Management is overseen by the board, which is overseen by the Shareholders. 
    
### Reports
A Report aims at informing someone (the Receiver) of facts, opinions or alerts (the Content) by someone (the Reporter) for a specific reason (the Purpose). The Receiver can be one or more persons and can be a Manager, Staff, Supplier, Project Team, Stakeholder, etc. The content of a Report is mostly in written form (mail, memo, but could also be through a presentation either orally and/or with a deck, or even more formally through a booklet like Financial Statements. The Reporter is the person(s) disclosing the Report and can be a Manager (to his/her Manager), a Staff (to his/her Manager), the board (to Shareholders) etc. The Reporter often, but not always, prepares the Content.
  
The Purpose of a Report depends on the target audience of the Report:

#### Management Report
A Report for a Manager provided by a Staff, a Group or Business Function or another Manager! The Purpose is for a Manager to oversee Results from the Processes that were delegated (Routines and Projects) and adjust where necessary i.e., the focus is performance. In addition, this report is used to report on concerns coming from the Environment (Market Intel). 
  
#### Staff Report
A Report for Staff or a Group. The purpose of such Report is to inform Staff how they are performing on their (joint) Job Description. 
  
#### Marketing Report
This is a Report tailored to the Strengths of the Venture and can be used for Clients, or more generally any Stakeholder. 
  
### Monitoring
The content of Report can lead to a cycle of feedback and follow-up. Feedback comes in the form of suggestions for improvements. These suggestions are translated into actions and these need to be planned and monitored. Planning is done in the Planning cycle of Management, or within Operations if the action is to improve Run or Change. In all cases, it is important that any action determined within a Supervisory Process is closed timely.

## Business Functions
Business Functions are fundamental business topics within Operations and more broadly the entire Venture. Even if the core of a Venture are its Operations, a Manager will have to deal with transverse topics that permeate several aspects of Operations and can go outside of it. These topics do not always map or relate to a single aspect of Operations. Yet, being a holistic topic, they may require the POLC approach, particularly in larger Ventures.
  
Typical Business Functions are as follows (in brackets the Profile Tree item or items covered):
- Operations (Operations)
- Finance (Revenue, Cost, Assets, Liabilities, Equity)
- HR (Staff)
- IT (Assets)
- Risk (Risk)
- Compliance (Risk, specifically Regulatory risk)
- Legal (almost all aspects of Operations)
- Tax (Cost and Risk specifically Tax Evasion and equivalent)
- Procurement (Staff, Suppliers)
- Marketing (Clients, Competitors)
- Communications (Image, Client, Suppliers, Staff, and more broadly Stakeholders)
- Audit (Venture)
  
### Business Functions vs Operations 
In management literature, Operations is often *also* defined as a Business Function, hence the very first entry in above list. In the Management Framework, Operations are considered the core of a Venture, but that approach does not exclude Operations to be also considered a Business Function after all it is a category to which the POLC can be applied! There are, however, important differences between Operations and the other Business Functions. Operations define what the Venture is about, what Sector it operates in, the Processes within Operations are entirely different for Ventures in different sectors. For example, the Processes required for mining iron ore are completely different from the processes of transistor manufacturing. Business Functions on the other hand, are more generic. Finance in a mining company will follow similar Processes and metrics as Finance in a transistor manufacturing company, which will follow the same Processes as a consultancy company. 
Another, fundamental difference is that Operations generates Revenues. None of the other Business Functions do. Similarly, Operations have outward facing Objectives (to Clients) whereas Business Functions are predominantly inward facing (HR, Finance and Marketing being notable exceptions).
Like Operations, each Business Function has a structure, composed of Processes (Run, Change), Resources (Staff, Suppliers, Assets), Capital (Liabilities, Equity) and Results (Cost, Risk). Note that in Results there is no mention of Revenue as per above. By design the Capital required for each Business Function is likely small, but for the total of Business Functions there may be some Capital required. Lastly, Operations being the revenue generating Business Function, one can consider the other Business Functions support functions to Operations.
  
### Business Functions & Departments
Notably in large corporations Business Functions are are often so work-intense, that dedicated departments are set up for several or all of them. Such dedicated departments can be defined as Activities within Operations or as Suppliers to Management, or a mix thereof. In such cases, the difference between Suppliers and Business Functional departments is that the latter is often deemed internal to the Venture and often, but not always, has a strong focus on services provided to Management and less to the Operations.
Note that not all Business Functions are represented through departments as such, or if they do, they are regrouped or split within a departments. For example, the Department CorpSec or Corporate Secretariat often combines Legal and Tax in a single department. Some Ventures split Finance into two dedicated departments, one for Accounting and one for Financing. IT is nowadays a dedicated department, but that was not the case 20 years ago. Marketing may exists within Operations combined with the Sales department, etc.   
Ventures having an audit department often do not necessarily consider it a Business Function, but rather an independent organisation within the Venture. In the MF it is considered a Business Function.by the same token, smaller Ventures may not have dedicated departments for some or any Business Function. In that case Managers perform the Business Functions, or they rely on outsourcing or a combination thereof. In small enough Ventures, some Business Functions may not be relevant like Legal or HR (family run business for example).
   
### Business Functions & Functional Overlap
Many Business Functions have considerable overlap. For example, Procurement which is strongly concerned with Suppliers has a strong dependency on Legal with regards to the contracts between the Venture and the Suppliers. Such overlaps are the case for most Business Functions. 
  
### Business Functions & POLC
As explained earlier, the POLC are Management *Functions* i.e., like a mathematical function they apply a certain logic on some variables to produce some output or deliverable (put simply). The Business Functions are similar in that they apply some logic to produce an output specific to the topic they are concerned with. However, the logic applied in Business Functions is the POLC! Take for example Business Function Finance. The output of this function is recording and reporting of Financial data (Accounting) and creating the most efficient corporate structure such that Liabilities and Equity are optimally funding Operations (Financing). In order to do this, a Plan needs to be elaborated, Staff need to be organised to perform certain Activities in relation to these Finance topics, they need to be led by someone to achieve the Objectives set out in the plan and there has to be some form of Supervision and reporting to the Managers of the Venture and Stakeholders in the Funding, etc. In other words, the POLC are applied to specific topics of a going concern Venture. 
  
### Business Functions Exhaustiveness
The Business Functions discussed here can be altered to fit each Venture and Management Structure. As such it is possible to add and delete Business Functions from the list covered in this Framework. 
  
### Business Functions & Management
As discussed above, Operations is considered the core Business Functions even it is discussed separately in the Management Framework. As such, when looking at the full scope of Management it can be seen that Management covers all possible angles of both the approach to Management (POLC) as well as the different aspects of a Venture to apply it to (Business Functions). As such, through the exhaustiveness of Business Functions as discussed here, Management is indeed all-encompassing. 
    
The following sections cover the key Business Functions.
________________________________________
## Operations (revisited)
Operations was discussed extensively earlier in this note as the key component of any Venture. Here we focus on some differences on how the scope of Operations in the Management Framework versus other approaches. 
In the Management Framework, Operations contains everything that makes up the day-to-day of a Venture: Processes (Run and Change) being performed by Resources (Staff, Suppliers and Assets), which are funded through Capital (Liabilities, Equity) all yielding Results (both desired: Revenue, and undesired: Cost and Risk). Another way Operations can be looked at is focusing only on the Processes assuming all the other elements are necessary input or output. This approach, focusing only on Processes or 'the things that need doing' is often used in literature (Slack, 2013). In the Management Framework, Operations is larger, but this larger scope does not make the literature invaluable, far from it. Operations Management is a fundamental topic of academic study and is taught notably in most MBA programs. It consists of the principles of Management applied to Operations in other words, it studies how to Plan, Organise and Lead the Operations, and how to Control it.   
________________________________________
## Finance
Finance, or more holistically Accounting & Financing is the Business Function concerned with measuring and reporting financial items related to the Venture and assuring Funding.
  
Key deliverables of Finance are the following:
- Accounting
- Financing

### Accounting
Accounting assures the Accounting Cycle is performed. Essentially this means:
   
1. Collecting and processing of financial data like Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Cost and Dividends (Withdrawals) and assuring the Accounting Equation remains balanced:
  
Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity or 
Assets = Liabilities + Stock + Retained Earnings or 
Assets = Liabilities + Stock + Revenues - Expenses - Dividends
   
More details are provided in "Management Framework Appendix".
  
Note that a key part of Accounting includes Processes to formalise in which manner Revenues are *recognised*, same for Expenses, Assets, Liabilities, etc. Such recognition should be formalised throughout the Venture.
  
2. Reporting of those data both economically and accounting-wise through relevant reports for internal and external use e.g. Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash flows, and any Key Performance Indicators that are relevant to the Venture.
  
### Financing
Financing a.k.a. Corporate Financing is concerned with implementing a corporate structure and Funding that structure. It is this closely related to deliverable of Funding within Organising. It has the following key elements:
1. Initial Funding for Assets, Staff and Suppliers
2. Continuous funding for Operating Costs
3. Investing in the Future of the Venture (funding Projects)
4. Optimizing the above a.k.a. Capital Management across multiple entities within the Venture see, [## Legal].
  
As discussed in [## Liabilities] & [## Equity] Capital can be achieved through:
- Long term debt  
- Short term debt including overdraft
- Purchase on credit 
- Share issuance
- Retained earnings
  
This deliverable is also referred to as Financial Planning or Budgeting. 
NB: in some text books Finance & Accounting are considered separate Business Functions. 
________________________________________
## Human Resources
Human Resources a.k.a. HR is the Business Function concerned with attracting, training and retaining Staff with the right Skills, Knowledge and Experience within the boundaries of employment laws. In addition, HR is also the central function for disseminating the Venture's Mission and Values. Although managers often very involved in the various deliverables involved in HR, the Business Function HR is central to the overall functioning.
  
Key deliverables of HR are the following:
- Recruitment
- Skill Management
- Training
- Performance Management
- Remuneration Management
- Job Satisfaction Management
- Employee Relations
- Employment Law

### Recruitment
Recruitment is the Process of attracting Staff with the right Skills and Experience i.e., for a specific Job Description. HR may rely on Communications as Business Function, if the Venture wants to recruit many different people at once (notably the case of successful startups). In addition to Skills and Experience, HR is strongly involved in the assessment whether the Personality of the Staff is a right fit. 
    
### Skill & Knowledge Management
Skill Management is the function that defines the Skills required to be able to operate within a Group as well as measuring those Skills in prospect and existing Staff. Skills are formalised in the Job Description (see above). Knowledge Management follows similar concepts. 
  
### Training
Training is the process of adding new Skills or Knowledge or improving existing Skills through various means such as to aid in maximising Staff Performance.
  
### Performance Management
Performance Management is the function of measuring performance of Staff versus their potential as well versus Objectives. Objectives are as per the Planning and include both Routines and Projects. An important aspect of Performance Management is reviewing *how* Objectives were achieved and to what extent the Staff is yielding its full potential. 
  
### Remuneration Management
Remuneration Management details the manners in which Staff can be attracted and retained. 

### Job Satisfaction Management
Although Remuneration is an important reason for Staff to work for a Venture, this may not be the only one. Job Satisfaction Management encompasses all the other reasons for which a Staff can work for a Venture. Such reasons can include:
- Health Insurance
- Commute Time
- Daycare facilities
- Working hour flexibility
- Etc
  
### Employee Relations
Employee Relations refers to the relationship with Staff on a broader basis. It includes creating awareness of the Venture's Values, providing a platform for dispute resolution, etc.
  
### Employment Law
Ventures operate under various laws depending on the Environment in which they operate. Most countries have some form of Employment Law and the HR department's role is to assure compliance with such laws.
________________________________________
## IT
Information Technology (IT) or Information & Communication Technology (ICT) are two different but very similar topics. IT includes use of computers, networks, software and other electronic or digital devices for the management and communication of information. ICT focuses more on how digital technologies assist users in handling information. In the Management Framework IT considers both IT and ICT.   
  
IT is critical to most Ventures because the majority of Input in the various Processes throughout a Venture are all digital. Even if an Activity's purpose within a Venture is to make say wooden cupboards, the details of the inventory used e.g. wooden panels, screws, glue, paint (Assets) are stored digitally, as are details of the Suppliers delivering it including details of shipment etc. as are details of the end-products, and to which Clients they go. Even the manufacturing Process itself can be wholly or partially automated, which means, again, IT involvement.
  
Key deliverables for IT are:
- Infra
- Applications

### Infra
IT Infrastructure or Infra is the total of hardware and software needed to run Applications. This includes, but is not limited to:
- PC's
- Laptops
- Servers
- Virtualised versions of the above three 
- Networks (LAN, WAN with interconnection of Routers, Switches, Bridges, Firewalls, Cables, ...)
- Local Storage (NAS, SAN)
- Cloud Storage and Cloud Services
- System Software 
   
Most of the components above have a minimal software referred to as system software. This includes operating systems and utility software. The latter includes backup-software, anti-virus etc. 
  
### Applications
Applications are the software that aid the Venture directly or indirectly in producing the Services. There are different ways of approaching Applications, but a simple structure is to divide Applications in two broad categories:
- Supplied Applications
- In-house Applications
   
The former includes all off-the-shelf software i.e. software that is not part of the core Services of the Venture or which are so common that they would not lead to a competitive edge. In-House applications concerns software that contributes directly or indirectly to the Services and either may have a competitive edge and/or has features that cannot be found in off-the-shelf software. Applications also include Artificial Intelligence or any of its derivatives. 
________________________________________
## Risk
Risk is both a result from Operations as well as the name of the Business Function dedicated to the management of Risk. As a Business Function, Risk is concerned with the assessment of Risk resulting from the performance of Operations including Risk embedded in the Services and Products resulting from Operations as well as the Risk that the performance of Operations engender. Assessment includes analysing, measuring, comparing to benchmarks of Risk as well as defining plans to mitigate said Risk. 
________________________________________
## Compliance
Compliance is concerned with the assessment of adherence to rules and regulations imposed by the Environment as well as adherence to internal rules and regulations. Compliance is thus concerned with a specific form of Risk discussed earlier under [## Operations]: Regulatory Risk. Regulations are defined by regulators often to protect individuals or groups in society and can involve different types of protection, ultimately all geared towards the protection of individuals:
- Environmental protection (nature, pollution)
- Client protection (ombudsman, financial regulations, data protection)
- Etc.
________________________________________
## Legal
The Business Function called Legal is concerned with the assessment of contractual obligations the Venture engages or envisages to engage with Stakeholders (internal as well as external) or, the assessment of any obligations applicable to the Venture by virtue of it being incorporated or operating out of a country. This also involves anything related to the obligations that weigh upon legal entities involved in the Venture. 
  
The scope of Law is large. It includes any contract (including disclaimers within contracts) like employment contracts, contracts with Suppliers like Service Level Agreements, contracts linked to the Services offered to Clients. It also includes any legal action of the Venture against a breach of such contract, but also any Legal action of anyone against the Venture for breach of contract or legal obligations. 

Deliverables for legal are:
- Legal Opinions
- Litigation
- Entity Structure Management 

### Legal Opinions
In case of contractual matters Legal is asked to provide an Opinion of the impact of the contract.

### Litigation
Although not desirable, it is entirely possible that the Venture is subject to some form of litigation. Such litigation can be initiated by any Stakeholder.

### Entity Structure Management
The Venture is incorporated under some legal structure, and if the Venture is a large one, different legal entities may be involved. 
________________________________________
## Tax
The Business Function Tax is concerned with the assessment of tax obligations the Venture is required to comply with as part of its role in the Environment, including arm's length principles across wholly or partially owned legal entities in different countries involved in the Venture. One of the main functions of the Tax Department is to provide Tax Advice at all relevant Management Levels in relation to tax implications for Services offered or the broader tax obligations the Venture is under. This Tax Advice requires constant review with new or changed Activities delivering new or altered Services and with the Corporate Structure of the Venture evolving, as well as the exogenously evolving tax rules applicable to the Venture and its Services.   
________________________________________
## Procurement
Procurement a.k.a. Supply Chain Management a.k.a. Purchase Management is the Business Function concerned with defining which Suppliers would be best suited to provide Assets and Services and possibly even Staff (in the form of consultants), and attracting and retaining these Suppliers whilst controlling the Cost and Risk related to the Suppliers. The following are key parts of Procurement:
  
- Supplier Management
- Purchase Management 
  
### Supplier Management
Supplier Onboarding is the process of defining the needs such that one or more Suppliers can compete for offering Services and/or Assets. This process can be short for simple Services/Assets, and can be much longer if the Service/Asset is more bespoke. Onboarding involves finding the right fit based on quality of Service/Asset, Costs, sustainability of the offering, credibility of the Supplier, etc. 
Depending on the type of Supplier there can be regulatory or legal implications. In most cases a legal agreement needs to be drafted which requires the help of Legal.  During the lifetime of the Supplier, updates to existing agreements may occur for example because the scope of Services is increased. 
Offboarding is the reverse, and can include an Onboarding if the Supplier needs to be replaced.  
  
### Purchase Management 
Purchase Management's main focus is the actual purchase of Assets and Services and payment to Suppliers once they are onboarded. It also includes reporting of Costs and actual benefits obtained to Management. In large Ventures the Purchase Management activity can be very elaborate with dedicated Staff and Assets like Purchase Software, and Software tracking deliveries made by Suppliers, particularly.  
________________________________________
## Marketing 
Both Marketing and Communications deal with communicating to Stakeholders. They differ in the target groups. Marketing is the Business Function concerned with intentionally stimulating demand for and purchase of Goods and Services produced through Operations for existing or future Clients. It includes defining target *Clients*, attracting them and retaining them. Defining Clients involves establishing the Services and/or Products the Clients desire/need as well as pricing those Services/Products and establishing how to advertise the Venture's capabilities to deliver the Services/Products in a manner optimal for the Client. From a Management perspective the Sales activity is part of Marketing. In many cases, Sales and/or Marketing are considered Activities instead of Business Functions. 

Key deliverables of Marketing are the following:
- Product / Client
- Price / Cost
- Place / Convenience
- Promotion / Communication
________________________________________
## Communications
Communications is the Business Function occupied with the Image of the Venture and the general brand name awareness both external and internal.   
________________________________________
## Audit
Audit is responsible for an independent Control of part or whole of Operations. The focus of Audit can be different:
- Conduct of Staff
- Adherence to internal and/or external rules 
- Efficiency of Operations  
- Efficiency of Business Functions  
- Existing zones of Risk or emergence of new Risk 
- Financial performance (Revenue, Cost)
- Performance of Management in discharging their duties
- Etc
  
There are two broad types of Audit:
- Internal Audit
- External Audit

The former is often used for ongoing review within above focus points. The latter is often called in for specific topics. One recurring use of External Audit is the yearly so called Statutory Audit of the Finances of a Venture (for listed companies). External auditors are deemed a Supplier and thus fall within Supplier Management, see above.  
________________________________________
## Management Cycle
The foundational concepts of the Profile Tree as well as the deliverables within Management (POLC, Business Functions, Tools) help a Manager structuring the various aspects involved in Management. The segregation of specific topics transversal to Operations and the Venture as a whole into Business Functions helps focusing on key aspects of the Venture and the objectives of the POLC and the purpose of Tools shape in that process
   
Each aspect of the POLC, Business Functions and Tools thus help the Manager to understand the fundamental building blocks of Management. They aid in making sure key aspects of the Venture are covered, as in the Manager makes sure he thinks about all the concepts that make up the Venture he is  Managing.
  
The *practical implementation* of these theoretical concepts is performed through a continuous iterative process, referred to as the *Management Cycle*. When the terms "Management" or "Managing" are used, it refers at the same time to the theoretic concepts of POLC, Business Functions and Tools, as well as the practical implementation of it in the Management Cycle. 
   
At this point it is worthwhile providing an illustration of how the Management Cycle applies. In this example the production of Financial Statements will be used. Such statements need to be produced at specific intervals (Planning) either because of some legal obligations under some corporate law (Legal) and/or because of regulations (Compliance). These requirements can also change over time which requires regular review of those obligations (Intel). There are often requirements as to the auditability of the statements (Audit) as well as the production of the data from the various systems (Operations) into accounting statements (Finance - Accounting) needs to be reviewed by relevant staff with the skills to do so (HR - Skill & Knowledge) and the results needs to be reviewed and certified (Controlling, Finance - Accounting) including by an independent external auditor (Procurement) and there may be deadlines that require people to readjust current priorities (Leading). The entire structure to do this on a recurring basis needs to be maintained and adapted over time (Organising). There is likely a need to frame such entire setup in a Framework and possibly specific Procedures (Tools). The total of it should be maintained in an Operational Plan (Planning). The list can go on in more details covering more aspects. The net result of the above is the audit approved financial statements, which is something that falls within Accounting. 

This simple example shows not only that a Manager needs to mix various aspects of Management in a cycle, but it also shows, the manager needs to have a very broad range of Skills & Knowledge to be able to do his job effectively. 
  
Depending on the Management Level a Manager may need to perform different Routines as part of the Management Cycle.
For example, a Manager can assess the Activities and Groups on a recurring or ad-hoe basis, but he may not need to spend any time on redefining the Mission or Values of a Venture. Or the four types of Supervisory Processes (Check, Review, Attend, Audit), yield recurring Routines the Manager needs to work on. In most cases the Manager meets Staff and Suppliers to Lead and other Stakeholders to Report.  Because of this, the Management Cycle has no prescribed deliverables. However, the following reflect typical actions the Manager may perform in the Management Cycle:
- Plan
- Organise
- Meet
- Mail/Chat
- Check
- Review
- Attend
- Report
  
To conclude, the Management Cycle is the last deliverable of Management. It blends the other Management deliverables into an ongoing process or set of processes that yield what is expected from what this entire Framework is about: Management.
